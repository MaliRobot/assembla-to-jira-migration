# EC-1646 The solution used [here|https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-npc/tickets/1518/] follows the technique used for the Europeana logo: it uses a background image defined in the CSS.  This works because relative paths in CSS are resolved relative to the stylesheet, not the app server, and so the div added in the CMS with the class "opus-img" corresponds to a CSS rule that gives it the background image "europeana_opus.png"

Given that we do have this inter-team/product blocker, I would be inclined to include this in the next sprint.

# EC-1511 The first thing we could do is to get annotations to display in Europeana. The [Wikidata experiment|https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/35/details] seems the perfect candidate for this. No additional work for this is needed on the Annotations API and the benefit is that Collections can already start exploring how to connect with a different API and pull in annotations. We probably shouldn't label them as such as that would imply to users that they can add annotations themselves.
# EC-1873 As discussed here: https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/437-entity-api--improve-(production)-paths/details
# EC-1889 In https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/344 we implemented the import from Commons of links to media files there from our objects. But these links are not displayed to the user. This should be fixed.
# EC-1938 The issue is that the Annotations API has just implemented the standard profile (see https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/65) and made that its default profile, which Europeana Radio is not capable of parsing. As the production Annotations API will not yet accept the profile parameter, even just to ignore it, it is necessary to make Europeana Radio capable of parsing both the minimal and standard profiles, whichever happens to be returned by the Annotations API it is connected to by default.

# EC-2311 The Record API has been adapted to issue 301 redirects for records whose IDs have changed: https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/662
# EC-2373 The GET method of the Entity API has been updated to expose the Wikimedia Commons link in the response, see ticket [API ticket 755|https://app.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/755]. This change implies that the value of the depiction field is no longer a string (URI) but a structure made out of an "id" and "source" fields.
# EC-2374 We have recently noticed that the Entity API had not been updated following an update of spec that was done a while ago, see [API ticket 760|https://app.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/760]. In particular, the field "contains" and "totalItems" were not changed to respectively "items" and "total".
