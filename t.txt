101366873,2,Import the Europeana Sounds vocabularies into OpenSKOS,"*Task:*
Import the Europeana Sounds genre vocabulary to our OpenSKOS and expose them as dereferencable SKOS-entities.

Note: Please add sub-tasks to this story as needed.

*Background:*
To support better discovery (eg. facets, autosuggestions, entity pages, browse entry points) for Audio and Music related content the Europeana Sounds project have created a simple sounds genre vocabulary.

Further down the line it is our intention to exploit those vocabularies in the planned Europeana Music Channel in the form of e.g. a Genre facet, in autosuggestions and as browse entry points. The vocabularies as a whole should also be accessible via technical interfaces and individual SKOS-concepts must be dereferencable. We have thus decided to import them into the Europeana OpenSKOS instance and make the vocabularies available as data.europeana.eu URIs.

*Vocabulary file:*
Available in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OBc99QlfM3vZTt8xz-ZzleCTR95NIvsnxyLEDGA-qp0/edit#gid=1343309685 

Note 1: Ignore the Out of Date tab.

Note 2: Some terms have multiple narrower terms. These are represented in one column ""Narrower terms (resource - internal)"" and separated by space;space. If this format for narrower terms should be changed to another separator just do so.

Note 3: The columns filled in in grey can be ignored in the import.

*Vocabulary codes and titles in OpenSKOS:*
Collection is sounds, http://skos.europeana.eu/editor/collections/edit/collection/sounds
Scheme is soundgenres

*Content negotiation:*
When browsers request a URI they should be re-directed to the HTML-page of a term
When non-browsers request a URI they should receive the SKOS/RDF response

Break out the content negotiation to a discrete task if preferred.

103563973,3,blacklight: admin functionality,"*story*
as a curator or europeana admin, i want to be able to alter application configuration in order to control various elements of the application:

* ideally, settings are made via a gui
** however, initially, an i/f for adjusting a json or yml config file would be fine.
* access to all admin functionality should be determined by a user management module
** ideally this would use a europeana api service, which does not yet exist at this time
** in the meantime, allow modifications without user management

*application elements*
these need to be further defined and given their own story in order to work out the implementation details for each element, however, for the moment, this is to give a general idea of the type of configurations that need to be available:

* home page
** background image
* channel management
** data parameters
*** query that defines the channel
** branding
*** logo
*** name
*** description text
*** colour
** featured items
*** image

104180813,6,Blacklight: query Europeana REST API (not Solr),"Blacklight provides an interface to a Solr instance and its indices, and as such its use depends on the existence and accessibility of a Solr instance. In the case of a Channels application, search and record retrieval would need to occur via the Europeana REST API. Given Blacklight's coupling to Solr, this is a seeming obstacle to its use for Channels.

However, given that: a. Blacklight utilises the RSolr library to communicate with Solr, and; b. the Europeana REST API supports certain elements of the Lucene query syntax; it was speculated that a variant of RSolr could be developed to act as an ""interpreter"" between Blacklight and the Europeana REST API. To Blacklight it would appear that queries were being sent to a Solr instance, while this RSolr variant would in fact adjust queries to the format expected by the Europeana REST API, send them to it, and alter the responses to appear as though from Solr.

A proof-of-concept should be created to demonstrate whether this is in fact feasible.",3,2015-02-04T10:27:31.000Z,,2014-12-02T19:15:28.000Z,0,-3.0999999046325684,false,7270983,"bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2015-02-04T10:27:31.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""Environment & Architecture""}",1,,,

* Configurable response model (in addition to configurable response document model) may pave the way for returning non-flat documents from REST API, e.g. having multi-lingual labels, representing relationships between entities. Would require some overriding of views and/or helper methods to work with custom document model.
* New extendable action framework establishes a formal way to add functions to Blacklight's default UI, e.g. including the links to content Channels in the navbar.

The new portal with channels must have at least the same My Europeana functionality that the current portal has. The question is whether new portal/channels should work directly with My Europeana or via a My Europeana API? We also need to make a thorough review of roles in My Europeana and analyse how they should be extended or modified as a result of the introduction of Channels.

The expected outcome of this spike is a technical strategy for how we implement My Europeana in the new portal/channels. The solution must also take into account planned features that likely have a connection with My Europeana (e.g. public user annotations) and must anticipate on the API supporting more than just read operations that require more complex authorisation rules (potentially roles as super administrators, Channel administrators, superusers etc.).

112160223,42,SPIKE: Channel content filters strategy,"
h1. Background 
We have decided that while we will have channels on many themes we want to have a unified database and search index. Anything else would be inherently unscalable. But we need to be able to in an easy and flexible manner select the content to be included in a particular channel. And to do so in a way that does not impact negatively on performance.

*Expected outcomes*
As a result of this spike we should have investigated different options for how to implement the content selection and outlined a technical solution for our choice.

*First ideas*
_Hidden query:_ In the Proof of Concept this has been accomplished by adding hidden filters to all queries within a channel. See https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-npc/wiki/Channel_filters While simple, this method does not allow for fine granularity of content selection and may have negative impact on performance (lots of OR queries). 

_Macros and Batch Machine Tags:_ A second idea we've discussed is to create ""macros"" based on queries. We would then create one macro per channel (and perhaps also other macros e.g. a GoogleFielTrip macro). These macros could then be exposed for search via the API.
 
An extension of the idea would be to see the macros as an intermediary step in batch machine tagging all objects within the macro result. For example we could then use the complex query for the Music Channel (see link above) to add the value Theme=Music to all individual object hit by the query. The Theme field would be indexed and faceted for search making it possible to in the channel itself simply add the hidden query AND THEME:Music. My Europeana users with a specific level of priviliege coluld then also individual tag or de-tag objects for inclusion in a Theme/Channel. We could thus offer both a way to make a first rough defintion of what objects to include in the channel and allow object per object granular control.

As Europeana we are expected to offer access to our services and content in all official European languages. We also currently support some non-official languages like Basque, Gallego, Catalan, as well as languages of non-EU members, like Russian, Norwegian, Icelandic, etc. We may wish to extend support to include some larger non-European languages like Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Standard Arabic and so on.

*Expected outcome:*
- Decision on how to store localized text (YAML?)
- Decision on environments for entry and localisation of copy and static texts (LocaleApp + TranslateWiki?)
- Decision on whether to support Right to Left (RTL) languages/display. (Inlcude investigating libraries like https://github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus ). 
- Language and SEO, see https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/2370587?hl=en&ref_topic=2371375
- Agree on a convention for constructing localisation keys

*Assumption:*
We'll use the rails-i18n gem for basic words, numbers, dates, months, weekdays. etc.

*Note:*
In Europeana 1914-1918 we use Ruby i18n, YAML, LocaleApp for original English copy and TranslateWiki for localisation.

112232333,60,SPIKE: Improve testing and documentation for APIs,"
h1. Background 
As Channels will rely heavily on our API testing and documentation become more vital than they already are. We need to have ways to quickly test changes to the API and need to have proper functional and technical documentation. This ticket is to explore some ways to make testing more and quicker accessible and the same applies for the technical documentation (functional documentation will all be on Labs). This of course is complementary to the work done on unit testing, which is more about testing whether the code works but does not take the API itself into account.

We've had some good experience with [[url:http://swagger.io|Swagger]]:
http://node5.novello.isti.cnr.it:8888/doc/#!/jsonp/query
Swagger is something you include in your application, and then you can annotate API calls in your code. Swagger will then automatically generate technical documentation and a testing interface such as the above. This allows for rapid testing (by developer, testers and POs) without the need for additional development. But of course there may be other alternatives.

*Expected outcome*
* Assess whether there is added benefit to such a solution
* Listing of some options along with a preferred choice
* Estimate on the work required to apply such a library to our current REST API along with documentation
* Listing of API testing procedure (e.g. phase 1: unit testing, phase 2: swagger testing, phase 3: continuous testing and monitoring with Nagios and Runscope)

113696893,105,SPIKE: Investigate Spotlight as a solution/UI for creating channels and exhibitions,"[[url:http://spotlight.projectblacklight.org/|Spotlight]], a plugin for Blacklight, enables librarians, curators, and others who are responsible for digital collections to create attractive, feature-rich websites that highlight these collections. A logged in user (a curator, special collections librarian, Europeana Channel Curator, etc.) can set up and publish an exhibition in a WYSIWYG interface. 

This makes it a very attractive candidate for Europeana to power our curated exhibitions. Choosing a Blacklight plugin would consolidate our portal/channels/exhibitions solution around Blacklight and Ruby on Rails, reducing the number of ""moving parts"". As with Blacklight the DPLA have also chose Spotlight to power their future exhibitions which would also allow us to share development burdens with them (and Stanford University, the lead developers of Spotlight).

Therefore we need to investigate the feasibility of using Spotlight as the ""Europeana Exhibitions CMS"".


This spike has two strands of investigation:
1. What effort would be needed to configure a Spotlight instance that would allow us to use it as Europeana's ""exhibitions CMS""?  

 A challenge is that Spotlight assumes local access to Solr. We want to dogfood our API. Can this be reconciled? Or would we need to bite the bullet and accept to not dogfood with our exhibitions?

This investigation also needs to take into account that if we choose Spotlight as our exhibitions we would need to gradually migrate our [[url:http://exhibitions.europeana.eu|existing exhibitions]] from Omeka to Spotlight. This migration will likely be largely manual. Note that the exact layout and look and feel of the current exhibitions need not be preserved. The plan would rather be to redesign them in that regard to harmonise with the channel design and ""feel"" fully integrated in the new portal/channels.

Supporting localised/translated versions of the same exhibition is a hard requirement.

Combining curatorial text and selected Europeana items into a longer and navigable narrative is the primary goal of the exhibitions.

2. I wonder if we could use Spotlight as a way to allow My Europeana users with certain rights to create, contextualize and publish individual Channels? Basically by modelling each Channel as a Spotlight exhibit?


Links for information:
The [[url:https://github.com/sul-dlss/spotlight/wiki|Spotlight Wiki]] has good information on the system architecture of Spotlight. 
We're also in direct contact with Chris Beer who's one of the main developers of Spotlight and who we can ask questions and setup calls with if needed.

Typically this is accomplished by data partners including links to media files in edm:isshownby and edm:hasview. Some partners however have opted to publish their media content on commercial platforms. 


The solution should:
* ideally be generic (i.e. we should avoid solutions that are 100% player specific)
* ideally be standards based, the standard in question being [[url:http://oembed.com/|oEmbed]] which most of the commercial platforms support.
* ideally not require data partners to update and resubmit data for re-harvesting and re-publication

The following standard players should be supported (listed in order of priority):
* SoundCloud
* AudioBoo
* Vimeo
* DailyMotion
* YouTube
* Sketchfab

For the first 4 datasets using these platform players are already available in Europeana.

The following custom players should be supported (and in order of priority):
* ""Picturepipe"" (used by Europeana 1914-1918 institutional partners for video)
* INA (video)
* EU Audiovisual Department (video)

Note that we have develop similar solutions in the past for Europeana 1914-1918 and the old portal:

Tech notes:
* In 14-18 we used https://github.com/judofyr/ruby-oembed to simplify adding the generic oembed support
* Our video player, video.js, has a plugins for a number of common commercial players, https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Plugins#playback-techs-support-media-from-different-sources

114066023,116,As a user I want to be able to view 3D models from Sketchfab directly in my browser,"Some of our partners use SketchFab as a site where they upload their 3D models so that others can access them. To display a SketchFab viewer of an object in the portal we need the identfier or URL in the equivalent Europeana record. So that we can make an oEmbed call, https://sketchfab.com/developers/oembed and fetch in the viewer into our display.


*Example object:*
http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048707/A_0_9_1144_3D.html is the same as https://sketchfab.com/models/f034728a1c224ef9b82b4cd8f80114f6 for which the oEmbed call is https://sketchfab.com/oembed?url=https://sketchfab.com/models/f034728a1c224ef9b82b4cd8f80114f6

To support this either the whole SketchFab URL would need to be in the Europeana record metadata or it would need to be part of an agreed field following a specific syntax.

For many reasons (TODO: list them all) we need to reindex the full Europeana corpus.

*Reasons:*
To fix errors in the ESE2EDM migration
To ensure that all items that have a edm:isshownby also have a corresponding WebResource
To ensure that all items that have a edm:object also have a corresponding WebResource
To ensure that all items have a corresponding WbResource for each edm:HasView (I don't know if this is an issue but adding it just in case)
To updated legacy data based on improved semantic enrichment rules, mappings and extended enrichment vocabularies. A MUST for e.g. the Art Channel.
To fix the number of proxyIn and proxyFor statements, see https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana/tickets/1288 in CAPE
Update the Completeness rating based on an improved formula for it
To get dc:descriptions consistently included in the Rich API search result. A MUST for the planned portal search result list view
Change the Solr setting to disregard accents in search keywords
And in any other way update the data structure across the whole corpus e.g. a new structure for separarating between data providers, aggregators and projects that do aggregation.
To create copy fields that allow us for truly querying for exact matches on title, who, what and other important fields, see https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-ingestion/tickets/1619-improve-relevancy-of-results-for-the-prototype-entity-autocompletion-api?comment=711706813#comment:711706813
To ensure that the search.json API response always has a title included, a MUST as well for the planned portal search result list view
To fix the URL to the thumbnail in the search.json API response, as it currently does not contain a TYPE parameter which leads to broken images on API clients
To make the Concept, Agent, Place and Timespans into true facets
To redefine existing or add new copy fields
To create copyfields / do workarounds to allow us to sort on multi-value fields like dc:title
To add serial numbers to the dc:titles of datasets where all objects have the same title (like photograph, object, item and similar)

*Note 1:*
We should ideally have a framework for doing this at low cost and quick turnaround time. As this is likely going to be a recurring task (at least the re-enrichment)

*Note 2:*
A full re-indexing will take 1-2 months and we should plan to not do any ingestions during that period as that would add a lot to the complextity",2,2015-03-31T08:42:48.000Z,,2015-03-16T17:32:29.000Z,0,-8.0,true,7877323,"ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,a7Pf3g-R0r4QpcacwqjQXA,cb4vRS9Yur4z_3acwqjQYw",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2015-04-13T11:39:05.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Search""}",2,,,

- there is NO ""apply filters"" step
- The Boolean operator within facets is OR, between facets is AND

More complicated facets (such as a date range chooser) will have an ""apply"" button that when clicked, updates the displayed results

Also need to take into account how selected facet values are treated:
* do they always appear at the top of the list of values for a facet, taking priority over number of results per facet value?
* do they count towards the number of values shown per facet?
* what if more values are selected for a facet than would usually be shown before a ""more"" link?",3,2015-04-03T09:18:02.000Z,,2015-03-23T08:41:33.000Z,0,-17.100000381469727,false,7877323,"djQ1OaATWr4Of6acwqjQYw,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,d6jVQyU8Gr44kvacwqEsg9",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2015-04-03T09:18:02.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,d6jVQyU8Gr44kvacwqEsg9,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Search""}",1,,timharbour,https://s3.amazonaws.com/assembla-avatars/1c6b3c1e/d6jVQyU8Gr44kvacwqEsg9:1422138695

115886563,163,SPIKE: Robust API-logging solution,"


h1. Goals of the design 

*Performance* 
Currently loading some statistics takes a very long time and often they don't load at all due to timeouts.

*Reliability*
In the past we have lost API-statistics for whole months.


*Note:*
One way of making the solution more robust would be to not display API-statistcis in-portal as currently but simply make monthly statistics available as CSVs.

Notes from Bram:
The current API logging should work on the Anynines setup. Once migrated, it should be turned back on; there is code available to select the Mongo server if the primary goes down.
Tests:
* check logging is enabled again
* check limit is working
* check primary server switchover
Anynines setup has changed, so need to re-SPIKE this. A solution is to migrate this to a relational DB (e.g. PostgreSQL), but there may be better/existing solutions out there.",3,2016-01-13T10:56:38.000Z,,2015-04-02T07:17:40.000Z,0,-55.0,true,7270973,"",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Invalid,0,2016-01-13T10:56:38.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,cGWssmatmr5kX4acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""""}",2,,,

As a developer I want to do query translation as a parameter in the API search call (and save myself the trouble of making two calls) 

*Background:*
Search term translation is at present made available via the translateQuery method of the REST API. For Channels to utilise this during search, it would need to make one call to the translateQuery method followed by a second to the Search method. As translation of query terms is a common requirement of searches given the multilingual nature of Europeana's data, it could be desirable to make query term translation an optional function of the Search method, e.g. by the addition of a translateLanguageCodes request parameter. This would reduce the need for clients to issue two calls to different methods of the API for each search.

*Acceptance criteria:*
This story is accepted when a developer can perform query translation as part of a search call. 
The developer must be able to supply up to 6 languages to translate a keyword query to. 
The developer must as part of the search call response receive all translations and which languages the translations are in (should be formatted the same as in the separate query translate call)
Query translation as search call parameter must be combinable with all other search call profiles
Query translation must be applied to keywords only,  NOT to facets, field names or copy field names. 
Query translation must be possible to combine with fielded queries and copy field queries

Reduce its overall height
Make it fold in/fold out?
Add header for the items statistics
Move recent additions to a ""box""?

*Browse entry points*
Visualise them (add images for them)

*Major feature option*
Introduce the ability for an editor to feature something very heavily among the boxes. Like the assymetric large box of https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/24165925/preview

In Music this could be their SoundCloud presence, in Art History it could be VanGoYourself or Culture Cam.

*Thematic blog posts*
Introduce them, at the bottom. 

*Footer*
How do we adapt the footer? Just a change of social media presence.

# Do we have a target maximum response time for all API queries? If so, what is it?
# Why are these queries so slow? Are they putting heavy load on the API servers?
# Do we consider these slow queries acceptable? If not, what should we do about them?
# If it is not possible to improve the performance of search queries faceting against any indexed data field, is it even appropriate to offer the facility to facet them to clients?

Remy's notes on the initial setup:
All the calls seem to work but there is still a lot of work to be done in proper naming, structuring etc. First step however, as noted in the other ticket, is to strip all methods that in reality do not exist (almost all methods, except MyEuropeana's have no other methods than GET). When that is done it would be great if we can explore the ""Content type"" filter. Currently it always includes ""application/json"", and there are separate API calls for json-ld etc. It would be great if for instance we have ONE API test for a record API, which then includes a dropdown with all the output formats: application/json, json-ld, xml etc.

*Acceptance criteria*
All methods that do not exists/work stripped out, so all methods except MyEuropeana have only GET.
One method in the UI for each API call, and move the different response types into the response type dropdown (e.g. for the GET record call the json-ld and rdf/xml options should be in the response type drop down)
API endpoint names and descriptions updated to make their naming consistent and understandable by 3rd part users.

This story is to be begun after #217 (see Remy's notes below, last paragraph). 

*Acceptance criteria:*
Performance significantly improved
Installed on a server where we can host it in the long run. Give it a proper DNS.

*Remy's notes on the initial setup:*
As for the Swagger editor: I find it very useful to trial and error API specifications with this, I think it would greatly benefit better and more complete specifications. There are however still a few issues which make this really hard. Maybe something for the next iteration:
It is very slow. There are many more API calls as they are in production, this is partly because all calls are available as GET/POST/PUT/DELETE etc. while in reality the API only has GET methods except from the MyEuropeana part. If this can be specified in the API this would greatly reduce the YAML output and make it faster.
Since our API consists of quite some methods, we might want to consider not rendering the output each time. Some guidance here:
http://azimi.me/2015/04/23/swagger-editor-talk.html

As next step I would recommend to focus on stripping down our documentation with the focus on the methods that exist first, aligned with what's on Europeana Labs. I'll put that into the other ticket.

121372763,251,iipmooviewer - prototype implementation,"*Business case*
A number of Europeana providers now support the image standard [[url:http://iiif.io|IIIF]]  . With IIIF we have at our disposal an efficient technology to display high-res zoomable images in the portal without having to necessarily store the images in a Europeana service. TEL is already exploiting this with their Newspaper viewer (example: http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/3000073484057?hp=1&count=10&page=1&query=wiener+zeitung ) which is a IIIF-client based on IIPMooviewer.

As TEL is already using IIPMooviewer we should prototype using it also in the Europeana portal. Reason being that the TEL portal is planned to be shut down and its newspaper search, browse and display be remade into a Europeana Newspaper Channel during 2016. By using the same technology that migration should be less time consuming than if we have to reimplement the TEL Newpaper viewer in another viewer framework.

In the TEL team Alena was the person who developed their Newspaper viewer and so would be capable of offering advise and insight on working with iipmooviewer if needed.

*Interaction*
User arrives to item display and sees edm:preview thumbnail. User clicks thumbnail to enlarge/read and at that point the IIIF-viewer is activated, the IIIF-manifest pulled in and the user sees the image(s). If there are multiple images in sequence pagination is available. 

*Source code*
* [[url:https://github.com/ruven/iipmooviewer|github repo]]

*Technical note*
Cross-domain issues may occurr. See http://sourceforge.net/p/iipimage/discussion/299493/thread/04708cac/ for solution and take help from Alena/TEL who have overcome this issue.

*Test items and datasets*
Only a small number of our data providers support IIIF. Our pilot partner is the French National Library who have IIIFed all their texts and images. In terms of implementation we may want to keep a config file listing which datasets or data providers support IIIF. 

Their data in Europeana; http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22National+Library+of+France%22

*French National Library*

Note the dc:identifier http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/9fb27615-ede3-4fa0-89e4-f0785acbba06
The corresponding IIIF-manifest is http://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/9fb27615-ede3-4fa0-89e4-f0785acbba06.json
so for Bodleian *the IIIF-manifest URI can be derived from the dc:identifier*

If as a result of the prototyping we would consider or conclude that IIPMooviewer is not fit for purpose we should test [[url:https://openseadragon.github.io/|Openseadragon]].

two possible solutions to the CORS issue:
* create a backend service that streams the media file from the same domain as the application
* create a backend service that streams the media file from a subdomain and add the CORS header to it

Also, videojs requires knowledge of the MIME-type and photoswipe requires knowledge of the pixel dimensions (width and height) of the image. To solve these issues we should extend the Ruby proxy already developed to expose pixel dimensions and MIME-type to the front-end.

123109173,284,SPIKE: Show data provider logos in the item display,"Story: As a data provider I would like my logo visible on the Europeana item to increase visibility of my institution.

NOTE: We're talking about data provider here (institution), not the aggregator (provider).

Constraints & givens:
* Providers do not have unique identifiers in Europeana's ecosystem.
* Providers have unique names, but these could change (always at providers request).
* Some providers are in Europeana represented with different names.

Long-term Europeana strategy:
* Providers will have unique identifiers (same as datasets and aggregators).
* Providers will become entities with their own URI.
* Provider information such as logo etc. will need to become part of the API.

Shorter-term business goal: show logos for Fashion providers on the Europeana Fashion collections' item pages.

Considerations for the spike:
* Create a webform where data providers can upload their image, which we should resize to a certain size.
* Link the image to a providers name, but make it clear in the webform that this is done and that if a provider changes name, they must re-upload their logo.
* How do we manage security for uploading and make sure correct images are uploaded? Who verifies? 
* As Europeana doesn't maintain and have unique identifiers, this might be an opportunity to start generating one. If we do, we must agree on a convention as an organisation. Later we could then export these identifiers to the authoritative data.

A suggested solution to fulfil the first business goal keeping in mind (and perhaps aiding) Europeana's long-term strategy.

2. Reconsider placement and layout of the text area under the hero. Why? User input indicates the blurb is not read  and the statistics to be of interest to only some users. Recent additions though is appreciated. We need to discuss options on how to change the visual hierarchy here. 
3. Discuss the visual design of the browse entry points. Why? User feedback indicated that apart from reading the subject value or name of the creator the text and also numbers of items was largely deemed of little importance to the users. 
4. Add the name Collections underneath the Europeana logo in the top menu. 
5. For now retain the name Channel despite its issues. Internal lobbying towards renaming the portal ""Europeana Collections"" and individual channels to ""(Europeana) [theme] Collections"" e.g. ""(Europeana) Music Collections"", ""(Europeana) Art History Collections"", etc. to continue.

Highlighted benefits of Rails Admin:
Official support for Rails 4.x
Support for Versioning support (via paper_trail gem)
Support for various Ruby file upload libraries (e.g. paperclip, carrierwave), which can use the fog gem for file storage on the cloud
Customisable authentication (Devise, like Blacklight) and authorisation
Native support for a selection of WYSIWYG editors
Easy installation, no clashes with existing functionality
No native support for translation of content, but globalize gem would provide this and rails_admin_globalize_field gem acts as glue between it and rails_admin
Support for custom field types, e.g. we could define one that looks up text from Localeapp translations if the editor enters a Localeapp key into a field in the CMS

To avoid serving development javascript code to beta users we need to point the acceptance/beta server to the correct CDN.

Our CDN is a pattern lab instance - Jenkins reports that it's been 4 months since production was updated (is that because the production branch of pattern lab doesn't build?) and current production apps hotlink to the develop pattern lab instance.


We can do two things, either we:

 - update production pattern lab and serve beta from there

but if that's problematic or risky then we could do this:

 - create a CDN snapshot: set up build task to copy js modules to ""dist-beta"" (parallel folder in our CDN)

 - create a ruby environemnt variable specifying our requirejs entry point (@js_entry set to ""dist-beta"")

 - read the new variable: in mustahe_helper.rb/js_files:
     change:
       styleguide_path('/js/dist/main/main')
     to:
       styleguide_path('/js/{@js_entry}/main/main')


(and then after we launch):

 - disable the build task that copies development work to parallel beta folder in our CDN

124996853,375,"SPIKE: IIIF-viewers (Mirador, Diva, Leaflet)","*Business case*
A number of Europeana providers now support the image standard [[url:http://iiif.io|IIIF]]  . With IIIF we have at our disposal an efficient technology to display high-res zoomable images in the portal without having to necessarily store the images in a Europeana service. 

Note we have tested IIPMooViewer and it cannot support our use case. OpenSeadragon can't currently. Universal viewer can but has some drawbacks like its reliance on Typescript.

*Viewer technology*
We should  test [[url:https://github.com/IIIF/mirador|Mirador]] first which is explicitly positioned as a IIIF-viewer capable of pulling in IIIF from multiple sources. [[url:http://projectmirador.org/|Mirador project page]]. In its demo you can actually load an image by pasting in its IIIF-manifest. An issue with Mirador is that it's ambition goes well beyond being but a simple viewer and so it is ""big"". They are working on a simplified version though.

Later we could  also test [[url:https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon|Openseadragon]] who have IIIF-manifest support on their roadmap. OpenSeadragon is a more basic viewer and thus more suitable to our use case of basic display, zoom and pan.There is a [[url:https://github.com/IIIF/openseadragon-rails|Ruby gem for OpenSeadragon to simplify using it in Rails based applications]] that should also be considered as part of the spike to estimate whether it could be useful to us. NOTE: Currently OpenSeadragon does not support rendering IIIF-manifests, see https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/issues/692 but the Mirador lead developer says he plans to create a plugin for it, see his response to a question of mine on the IIIF-mailing list here, https://groups.google.com/d/msg/iiif-discuss/lv1c0GSRJzo/CfRVbgWaAgAJ


After testing both we should decide which of them best suits us.

*Interaction*
User arrives to item display and sees edm:preview thumbnail. User clicks thumbnail to enlarge/read and at that point the IIIF-viewer is activated, the IIIF-manifest pulled in and the user sees the image(s). If there are multiple images in sequence pagination is available. 

*Test items and datasets*
Only a small number of our data providers support IIIF. 

*Bodleian Library*
Example object we can use is http://europeana-npc-test.de.a9sapp.eu/portal/record/9200175/BibliographicResource_3000004696986.html  

Note the dc:identifier http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/9fb27615-ede3-4fa0-89e4-f0785acbba06

The corresponding IIIF-manifest is http://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/9fb27615-ede3-4fa0-89e4-f0785acbba06.json
so for Bodleian *the IIIF-manifest URI can be derived from the dc:identifier*

In Mirador's demo site I loaded that manifest manually and got http://projectmirador.org/demo/#9da5eb2f-9bc2-4621-8318-670fe13e2c44

*French National Library*
Another pilot partner is the French National Library who have IIIFed some  their texts and images (the ones from Biblissima). In terms of implementation we may want to keep a config file listing which datasets or data providers support IIIF. 

Text example:
http://europeana-npc-test.de.a9sapp.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000094705862.html in Europeana which has the IIIF-manifest http://iiif.biblissima.fr/manifests/ark:/12148/btv1b84539771/manifest.json

The IIIF-manifest URI can be derived from the item's dc:identifier http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84539771

# Allow configurable cache expiration times for different API responses, e.g. 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, never (see point 2)
# Set up scheduled jobs to periodically re-query the API for data known to be needed by the site at all times, e.g. recent additions to channels, media type counts per-channel, and then _overwrite_ the existing cache entry, so that it never expires and hence no end user will need to wait while the API is queried.

125396193,403,SPIKE: Estimate effort of multiple item metadata and content download,"

*1.* 
Multiple items download via marking individual objects. Either A. in a search result, see https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/42152235/preview or http://demo.deanbirkett.name/5H336U/search_result.html ,  or B. from saved My Europeana items, see https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/78714750/preview or saved My Europeana items with a specific tag

Options: 
- Various metadata formats (JSON, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, CSV)
- With linked media or without linked media (with= the app tries to fetch the edm:isshownbys and edm:hasviews).


*2.* 
Multiple items download based on a whole search result, either A. directly from a search result or B. from saved search in My Europeana.

Options: 
- Various metadata formats (JSON, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, CSV)
- With linked media or without linked media (with= the app tries to fetch the edm:isshownbys and edm:hasviews).

Interaction, B: See https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/78754103/preview where the user would mark a saved search and choose Download as an Action (actions are top left).


*Notes*
- Ideally developed API-first with the portal acting as a client to an API that allows requesting these exports and fetching the output
- Metadata is retrieved via Get record calls. Support for CSV output would need to be added to the API. With CSV we'd also need to flatten/simplify the metadata, perhaps make it the equivalent of the Rich Search call response
- The generation of the exports must happen as a background job with the user notified, via mail and in their My Europeana pages, that the job is completed (or for some reason has failed)
- Metadata and media files to be zipped up for smaller disk space usage and quicker downloads
- Exports need to be persisted for more than a couple of days
- Exports of media may be limited to only media files that are CC-licensed or Public Domain (i.e. the two reusable values of Can I reuse it?)
- A cap on the max number of items possible to download must be configurable
- A cap on the max number of parallel exports a user can have must be configurable

*Comparisons*
- [[url:http://search.getty.edu/gateway/search?q=&cat=highlight&f=%22Open+Content+Images%22&rows=10&srt=a&dir=s&pg=1|Getty Search Gateway]] allows users to mark multiple objects and download their metadata in XML
- Auckland Museums allows download of item metadata from [[url:http://www.aucklandmuseum.com/collections-research/collections/search?pht=True&k=posters|search results]]

Not aware of any GLAM that does something exactly as we plan to here (asynchronous, metadata+media).

* Solution to help uses stay within a channel once they've entered it and are going back and forth between Channel landing page - Search result - Item display. Solution could be e.g. breadcrumbs.

Relevant wireframes to review and take into account:
* Settings menu: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/77477476/preview  the style here is ""thin"".
* Exhibitions menu (where user has set the UI language to German): https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/70544148/preview the style here is ""fat""

127418273,472,SPIKE: Technical research and rough estimation of updated exhibitions,"@andyjmaclean@gmail.com @cr.marcelino @richard.doe

After our kick-off last Thursday we agreed to work on a rough estimation of the technical requirements and time and effort it will take to realise the concept. 

I have added the wireframes to the ticket as attachments. 

Here you can find the demo: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/6E3W8B9JY#/screens
Here is the creative brief that will give you a little more background: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFv9WhWxxXrZgu0adkUXeA9ufrZT76VLo872QSbutgc/edit?usp=sharing
Here is an overview of the development goals: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7Ld8eTgdTJe8jScTdATTR4_pvyB8yp6tjd5NllWDSw/edit?usp=sharing

During our meeting we also mentioned ""pageflow"", which looks a lot like what we have in mind and might be helpful to check out: http://pageflow.io/en
I have signed up for the trial version, so should you need to log in, you can find the credentials here https://basecamp.com/1768384/projects/783910/documents/9610955

May the force be with you!

127713353,480,Add University of Heidelberg as a IIIF source,"Add University of Heidelberg as a IIIF source as they have an excellent collection of art historical publications. A type of content that can really shine on the Art History Channel. 

*Predictable pattern for the IIIF-manifest:*

Is easiest understood via an example

Europeana URL is http://test.europeana.eu/portal/record/07927/diglit_serradifalco1834bd2.html
IIIF-manifest is http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/iiif/serradifalco1834bd2/manifest.json

But note that there are always 2 dc:identifier values in this dataset. So if it's easier to use the single value Europeana item URL do so.

Ideally these should be as dynamic as possible, i.e. an editor should not need to update menu choices manually. However I would leave design and choice of implementation to @richard.doe .

In the first release of the top menu navigation we want the following top menu choices:

Home Channels Exhibitions Blog                                                 Settings (on the right of the Sites fold-up)

*Home:*
To work just as now, click it and you go to the portal base URL

*Channels:*
This is intended to have all available channels, listed in alphabetical order, as choices. At the very first release this would be the Music  only with Art History  being added soon after. After that we would not add more channels in a long while. I would suggest that the Portal CMS is the best tool to update this menu choice but I would leave implementation to Richard.

*Exhibitions:*
This is intended to list a small number (I would suggest 5-7) of the most recently published exhibitions and a link that goes to all exhibitions at http://exhibitions.europeana.eu

In terms of implementation I would see two main options:
A - to take them in from the exhibitions landing page RSS-feed, http://feeds.feedburner.com/Europeana-Exhibitions
B - to add them editorially in the Portal CMS

*Blog:*
This is intended to list a small number (I would suggest 6 as that's the number shown per page at blog.europeana.eu) of the most recently published blog posts and a link that goes to all blog posts at http://blog.europeana.eu

In terms of implementation I would see two main options:
A - to take them in from the blog RSS-feed, http://blog.europeana.eu/feed/
B - to add them editorially in the Portal CMS

*Settings:*
To go to the settings option pages. The first such page is the language settings controls Carlos is working on in #473.

In terms of implementation it seems to me that this one would need to be either hardcoded to always go to one Settings page where there's a side-navigation. Or that it is a ""drop-down"" the options of which are controlled in the Portal CMS. 

*Top menu choices*

128619333,509,Add support for multiple media items in the media viewer,"Currently the only media item available to the object page is that specified by the edm_is_shown_by.  We would like to be able to access all the media items related to the object.

An example record would be the Hammerflügel, available at this url in the api:

*	[[url:http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/record/09102/_GNM_693983.json?wskey=api2demo|http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/record/09102/_GNM_693983.json?wskey=api2demo]]

and here in the new crf api:

*	[[http://delta-api.de.a9sapp.eu/v2/record/09102/_GNM_693983.json?wskey=api2demo]]

This object has 13 .jpg images, 3 .mp3 and 2 .avi files, but currently only a single .jpg can be viewed:

* 	[[http://europeana-npc-test.de.a9sapp.eu/portal/record/09102/_GNM_693983.html]]


The urls for these media items are already available, but before they can be successfully displayed and played work is needed both on the front and the back end.


*The back end*

1) - normalise data

The edm-is-shown-by will always be included in the web-resource array, but it's possible that thumbnails will be included in the web-resource array too.  To build a full media-model the data should be normalised:

a) an array of urls should be created (let's call it ""url_array"") by concatenating the edm_is_shown_by url with the ""hasView"" array
b) the edm_is_shown_by url should be the first item of the url_array
c) duplicates should be eliminated from the url_array (this record, for example, has duplicates in the hasView: ""2048079/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Riksarkivet_953"")
d) the web_resources array should be filtered to only include elements the ""about"" field of which matches an items in the url_array

The filtered web_resources array forms the basis for the front-end model.

The items within it should have both a url and a mime type - this latter to help avoid the pitfalls that come with badly-mapped data, allowing us to vet urls that reportedly point to, say, a video or sound clip but which actually point to a web page that has a video or sound clip embedded within it.

The @mime_type variable used in:
	app/views/portal/show.rb

will no longer be needed once a normalised web_resource array is available.


2) - enhance proxy service

To avoid cross-domain errors we currently use a CORS-enabled proxy service:

	[[http://edm-is-shown-by.de.a9sapp.eu/09102/_GNM_693983]]

This works fine for the edm_is_shown_by web resource but not for the other images or media files.  Visiting the above url in a web browser will trigger a download dialog for an image, but it does not serve the other media files.

This service needs to be enhanced by / replaced with something more comprehensive, perhaps along the lines of the following:

	[[http://edm-web-resource/09102/_GNM_693983/escaped-web-resource-url-here]]



*The front end*

Current front-end architecture was designed with the multi-media file requirement in mind (the model defines an array of players required for an object rather than a single player, the javascript is structured to handle these players, the photo-swipe component is coded to make a gallery of all the web-resources that appear, etc.) but this architecture has not been finalised or tested.  Provisional investigations show that both the video player and the pdf viewer run into errors when they are re-initalised without a page reload.

The front end will be done when all available media can be viewed / listened to, closed and reopened without a page reload.

*Notes*

The new crf api is here:

h1. User story 

As a user I want to be able to browse for images in Europeana via colour.

*Design note:*
To support users who are visual thinkers and browsers the visualisation should be playful and enticing. Visualisations could use e.g. a bubble chart using the number of hits per colour to size the bubbles. 

*Interaction, basic*
The user chooses Colours under the Browse top menu. 

The user gets a full page (relative URL should be /portal/browse/colours) with an overview of all colours available in Europeana displayed in a grid. 

The user clicks a colour and gets a search result (with MEDIA TYPE = IMAGE automatically added)


*Comparisons:*
Remy's minimalist colour browse http://www.remy.tv/projects/europeana_crf/?action=colour    Link to a colour search result with media type=IMAGE activated, http://www.remy.tv/projects/europeana_crf/?action=search&colour=%23FF8C00&type=IMAGE

Cooper-Hewitt's collection by colour, https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/colors/



*MORE ADVANCED IDEA - IGNORE FOR NOW IF IT SOUNDS TOO COSTLY*

*Interaction, advanced*
The user gets a full page (relative URL should be /portal/browse/colours) width a bubble chart showing all colours in Europeana. The bubble are sized via their frequency of occurence with the number of items matching the colour within. When a user clicks a bubble a search is excuted for items of media type IMAGE that has that colour in them. 

As greyscale colours are likely to dominate there should be an option that makes it possible for users to filter them out.

*Tech ideas:*
Use d3.js http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269 and https://rubygems.org/gems/d3js-rails/versions/3.1.6 to implement the bubble chart?

# inconsistent “boolean” fields: SOUND_HQ only has “true”, no “false”; IMAGE_COLOUR only has “true”, no “false” with IMAGE_GREYSCALE as the inverse; TEXT_FULLTEXT has both “true” and “false”

test-annotations.europeana.eu

Within the europeana-client module there are implemented integration tests (junit) which test the basic functionality of the of the annotation API.

The base url of the annotation server is configured in the annotation-client.properties (this is available in the github repository but it should be deleted)
The template for generating the properties file is available in github.
https://github.com/europeana/annotation/blob/master/annotation-client/src/main/resources/annotation-client.properties.template

It is not required that the client tests are launched on the annotation server, it would be the best if we can run them from the Jenking environment.

Acceptance Criteria:
The required configurations or scripts are created so that the integration tests can be run with one click.
The integration tests are successfully executed (e.g. with the current status all tests sould success, anyway, if some of them fail, different tickets should be created)

It is currently only part of the portal profile.

h1. Steps to reproduce
See the documentation: http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search where in ""item"" it says that ""country"" should be part of the standard search response.
Run the following search query: http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&query=*%3A*&qf=DATA_PROVIDER:%22Bildarchiv%20Foto%20Marburg%22&start=1&rows=10&profile=rich,facets
Note how in the facets there is a facet called ""country"" which indicates all items in the search result have their country value set to ""germany"".
Note also how in not any item, there is a field named such.

When you run the same query with the portal profile, it seems OK: http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&query=*%3A*&qf=DATA_PROVIDER:%22Bildarchiv%20Foto%20Marburg%22&start=1&rows=10&profile=portal,facets

However, since profiles inherit each other, country should be part of standard & rich too.

h1. To-do
It should be fixed on the Delta API (branch, env?), as that will be the API that will be released to production first.

As you can see, the counts for the other facets are not correct anymore. This is because of the way the CRF facets work (facet/fake tags). I would be happy to explain in more detail, since that is a bit too much for in a ticket.

In short, for this ticket, the ""count"" field should be removed for all values in a CRF-facet (see epic for an overview), if one of the qf parameters in the search includes a search for this facet.
So when I would do &qf=IMAGE_SIZE:small, then all ""count"" fields within the IMAGE_SIZE facet should be hidden except for the ""small"" value.
Note that it is possible to search on multiple values, eg &qf=IMAGE_SIZE:small&qf=IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large. If I would do such a search, the ""count"" fields should be hidden for all values except extra_large & small.

I wonder if there isn't a role for highlighting the dynamic and expanding character of Europeana as well, however. The old portal offered (buried fairly deep in its structure) http://www.europeana.eu/portal/newcontent.html. In my own use of Europeana I found this somewhat useful: but would have found it even more so if subject headings and media (images/video/text) headings had been given as well as partner institution names.

New content: Madonna and Child (842 images) Medical Instruments (93 texts) Lvov, Ukraine (104 images) Jiri Kylian (23 videos) ... 84 other subjects

Such a widget would encourage users not immediately interested in banner contents to explore the site through other means and encourage repeat visits for updated content.

As greyscale colours are likely to dominate there should be an option that makes it possible for users to filter them out.

Since the new API often uses the edmIsShownBy for thumbnail retrieval, if you then use the edmIsShownBy against the current API, it likely will not work.

The URL in edmObject is ALWAYS the thumbnail.
Europeanastatic does not (yet) return the new thumbnails, this will be switched over later.
Until then, to retrieve a 400px thumbnails, use this (keyless) API call:
http://delta-api.de.a9sapp.eu/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=(EDM_OBJECT)&size=w400&type=(TYPE)
Make sure to replace (EDM_OBJECT) with an (urlencoded version) of the URL of edm:object and to replace (TYPE) with the object type, eg IMAGE/3D/TEXT/VIDEO/SOUND.
Replace w400 by w200 to retrieve the 200px thumbnails.

This ticket requires work from @andyjmaclean@gmail.com and input & work from @yorgos.mamakis@kb.nl (eg instructions + help in building the portal..). Final deployment requires work from @jaclu.

This ticket removes or changes features as covered in #595 and #596. Three things have to be done:

h1. Change 1: Remove option to go to the last page
Remove the "">>"" from the navigation on the search results page, it shouldn't be allowed for users to go to the last page anymore, just the first, next & previous ones.

h1. Change 2: Change page number from input field into literal
Currently, the portal search result page has a navigation which looks like ""<<  	  <  	2 of 1863582 Submit  >  	  >>"" whereas the ""2"" is an input field.
This needs to be removed, and changed into a literal. So <input value=""2""> becomes just the page number, in this case just the number 2.

h1. Change 3: Ensure user-friendly error message pops up in case of deep navigation
In case a user browsers beyond 1000 items, Solr/Corelib will throw an error message. This needs to be catched in a friendly way and rendered like that in the portal (just so that it doesn't show up as a 500 error or something, it should be something inline). Please align with @yorgos.mamakis@kb.nl as to how this message comes in.

*Suggested error message*: ""Sorry! It is not possible to paginate beyond the first 1000 search results. We've set this limit in order to preserve the stability of our service.""

h1. Change 4: Search widget
The search widget must be changed in the same way as above (1-3) as it also allows for ""free"" pagination.

@DavidHaskiya Please review this ticket and see if this is OK, @yorgos.mamakis@kb.nl same for you, do we cover everything with this?",1,2015-10-28T08:25:13.000Z,,2015-10-20T07:35:05.000Z,0,-90.0,true,8948623,",ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,aybbJ63Vur4BxmacwqjQYw",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2015-10-28T08:25:13.000Z,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,cGWssmatmr5kX4acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Search""}",2,,,

130972033,622,Make blurb terms clickable,"
1. As a user, I want to browse all the artifacts, books etc. that are mentioned in the strapline. 

*Problem:* 
There are words in the strapline for Collections and Thematic Collections (e.g. http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history) that refer to items in the portal, but are not clickable. 
This is either a missed opportunity for our users to browse, or can be completely irrelevant. 

*Solution:* 
This ticket is to allow the strapline text under Thematic Collections, but also for the general landingpage, for individual words to become clickable. 
As this can be configured via the CMS, perhaps we should make this a) a textarea, and b) allow either HTML or mark-down to support this? 
Example would be the Europeana strap line where these words become clickable:
...artworks, books, artefacts, videos and sounds...

*Acceptance Criteria:* 
- This can be done via HTML as part of the strapline text, the strapline text box in the CMS needs to be a textarea
- HTML needs to be formatted as HTML in the frontend

130973113,623,Cache generated HTML,"Without needing to run a stress test, it is quite apparent that the dynamic generation of HTML is _very_ computationally expensive in the new portal application and will put unmanageable strain on the platform to which is is deployed unless aggressive caching is put in place.

The excessive overhead is a combination of factors:
* fairly complex display logic, e.g. to account for all variations of metadata and media on an item page
* potentially large data structures, e.g. hundreds of facet values on search result pages
* use of tiny parts of Blacklight requiring all of it to be loaded
* use of Mustache templates instead of a templating language more widely used and/or better integrated into Rails

The use of Mustache templates is the biggest problem. Rails has very good caching built-in, the preferred being ""fragment caching"" with timestamps in cache keys alleviating the need for expiration. However, the Ruby Mustache library offers no way to leverage fragment caching.

The main alternative to fragment caching is ""action caching"" which we are able to leverage with little effort, but it has drawbacks:
* Timestamps in cache keys do not help so we will need to set expiration periods of 1 hour, 1 day, etc for each page. In the interim pages can and will become stale.
* No session-specific dynamic data can be accounted for. This is not an issue with different languages as there are few enough of them to cache one copy for each, but it is a problem on the item display page which has next/previous and back to search links that vary by user session.",1,2015-10-22T11:06:42.000Z,,2015-10-20T12:41:24.000Z,0,-90.0,true,8788473,"bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2015-10-22T11:06:42.000Z,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""Environment & Architecture""}",2,,,

131563663,643,Reconfigure Solr text-analysis chain,"The current analysis chain for the 'text' field-type in our schema.xml file could be improved in several ways.

# Stopword treatment: right now, the stopwords.txt file is entirely empty. It is possible to query Solr for common English stopwords ('the', 'of') and retrieve a result.
(nb: it is probably not desirable to strip stopwords entirely. In order to preserve phrase-querying capacity, a CommonGram approach should probably be used)
#  The configuration of the WordDelimiterFilterFactory is different in the query and analysis chains. This creates side-effects that are unexpected and probably undesirable. The current configuration is apparently intended to support queries by ID against contextual classes. A new approach to this (probably circumventing the text-analysis chain entirely for such queries) should be taken.
# The stemmer (SnowballPorter) is hyperactive - for example truncating 'Johannes' to 'Johann' and 'Anders' to 'Ander'. Investigate whether we need another stemmer, or whether an improved protwords.txt file will do the trick.
# The synonyms.txt analyzer is present, but the synonyms.txt file holds only stub data. 
# Multilingual support could be improved. In an ideal world we could use different analysis chains for different languages. Failing that, we can at least provide multilingual stopwords, and perhaps exploit the synonyms.txt field for multilingual support. The desirability of implementing the ICUNormaliser2Factory should be assessed

Note that implementation of schema changes will involve a full reindex of all content.

KISS! Let's keep it very basic and succinct. Copy over what is in current portal unless truly atrocious. Because the deadline is tight and the user gets easily bored with chunks of text.

* About (already exists /portal/about.html). Must be very short and point to Pro for more in-depth info about Europeana as an organisation. 
* Contact (equivalent of http://www.europeana.eu/portal/contact.html).  Skip the form for the MVP, can be added later..

As a user I want items to have a clear and good genre description so that I can find the items I am looking for/ fits my needs.
As a dataprovider I want my items to have clear and good genre description so that user can find it at Europeana.
As a user I want to be able to fill in the genre at a item so that I can share my knowledge and an item has the correct metadata.
As a data provider I want user to add extra metadata to my collection so that the metadata of an item is more complete and I don’t need to provide the resources for that.
As a data provider I want the crowdsourced metadata to be correct so that it doesn’t harm the collection and reputation of the institute.

Work involves:
Make an inventory of useful findings already done in WP2 and WP4

To designate to Google what the canonical URL is for all our item pages we must add a canonical URL markup to all item pages. This will ensure that when/if people share any variant URLs online to a Europeana item all the incoming link SEO value is gathered into the canonical URL.

Example:
For the item page http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048005/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Nationalmuseum__Sweden_23921.html the markup would be
<link rel=""canonical"" href=""http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048005/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Nationalmuseum__Sweden_23921.html""/>

Note that also the current production portal has this markup and can be used as the pattern.

This dramatically improves performance for common searches, e.g. promoted links and browse entries, and popular records, but does not scale well owing to the number of records Europeana makes available and the endless possibilities for searches.

Combined with A9s' reluctance to regard their Redis service as production-ready (i.e. scalable and high availability), caching of these expensive (to retrieve or compute) data was removed from the application prior to beta launch.

Redis is still used, but only sparingly, for RSS/Atom feeds, record counts (total items, sound files in music collection, etc.), HTML of static pages.

Dear Henning and Joris,
 
So amazing to see SMK’s collection finally in Europeana – and great that it coincides with the launch of the new portal / Europeana Collections!
 
However, there seems to be a general problem with our links [View at Statens Museum for Kunst] on the new portal. These links don’t lead anywhere, just refer to the general SMK collection overview in Europeana. This was not the case on the old portal, where the links would directly lead to image files from our cspic database. Do you know what the problem is? What can we do about it, so users don’t get stuck in a blind alley?
 
Apart from this, we are very happy to see the results of this long process. We have wanted our collection to go into Europeana for several years, so it is finally ChristmasJ

Dear Henning,

Congratulations on the launch of the new portal.  I’ve been browsing quickly taking a look at the Locloud and CARARE collections

I'm slightly confused by the language mark-up appearing around some of the titles.  This looks like a glitch.  See for example: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f[DATA_PROVIDER][]=N%C3%A1rodn%C3%AD+pam%C3%A1tkov%C3%BD+%C3%BAstav&f[PROVIDER][]=CARARE 
 
Some thumbnails seem to have disappeared - :
 
I think this collection used to display thumbnails: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f[DATA_PROVIDER][]=Riksantikvarie%C3%A4mbetet+|+Swedish+National+Heritage+Board&f[PROVIDER][]=CARARE
 
This one also: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f[DATA_PROVIDER][]=National+Archive+Norway&f[PROVIDER][]=LoCloud 
 
Ditto: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f[DATA_PROVIDER][]=Kulturstyrelsen&f[PROVIDER][]=LoCloud  This collection has images available behind the grey icon when you click on it in the record.
 
 
I’m not sure if its a glitch, a technical reason why the thumbnails aren’t appearing, or ?   Do you know?
 
 
This is a very superficial browse on my part, I haven’t had time today to look properly at all the new features (I’m sure there are many great new aspects)
 
With best regards,
 
Kate

Specification for the sort parameter is in the specification document:

136200183,824,SPIKE: Specification of first test moderation policy,"Some sort of moderation policy should be part of the first release of the Annotations API, and as suggested by Sound & Vision as well as discussed many times it is likely a down & up-vote system will be a fundamental part of it. 

See moderation principles and general outline here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2_RDuP5E2n0SBnZOqvjedqmKVoBavo6wtS0pN1UJtA/edit#heading=h.dqrv5qw17crw

We also agreed earlier that an up- and down-vote essentially is also a sort of annotation. However, I think we should make this more easy and straightforward. Naturally we can model up- and downvotes according to the specified model but the creation of it should be simpler. Here's what I propose for the first version plus some things to think about:

# Up & downvoting of annotations becomes part of the annotation, eg: POST /annotation/webanno/134/upvote & POST  /annotation/webanno/134/downvote
# These 'shortcuts' are essentially aliases of POST /annotation/moderate with a body containing the annotation as target & oa:moderate as motivation.
# We should have the number of up- and downvotes available per annotation, and also show it when a user does a GET request. Eg it could contain some kind of moderate class with the number of up- and downvotes and the aggregated total:
moderation: { 
  upvotes: 2
  downvotes: 1,
  total: 1
}

The total number should also be indexed (and updated) so a moderator for instance could search on annotations where the total votes is below zero.

I think something like this should work for the very first implementation. We don't need to think about removal of up- and downvotes for now. What we need is two API calls to post up- and downvotes and to have this information available as part of the annotation. As we don't have much time to implement it we should keep it fairly simple, also because this is not the final moderation policy & implementation.

Thoughts? Things I miss?

This is not ideal because:
* Engine Yard support for automated deploys by scripts (e.g. Jenkins jobs) is poor
* More of our production services run on Anynines, and proliferation of hosting ecosystems increases maintenance overhead, and likelihood of mistakes being made (also by having different chef-script languages)

It is recommended that we take the earliest opportunity in this tech debt sprint to move the styleguide deployments to another hosting environment, to two separate instances, one on test and the other on production.

This is move is a pre-requisite for developing the styleguide into a full and proper platform for front end development, allowing us to extend the styleguide capabilities to include
 * grunt scripts (see #843)
 * bower scripts  (see #842)
 * a same-domain nodejs server (see #844)

We have a couple of simplified ""main"" files that serve as examples of how requirejs can be configured for specific molecules in the styleguide with just a couple of lines of code.  These should be used as templates for designers who want to integrate js with their work, but don't want to have to get too deeply acquainted with requirejs.  The current scripts are not consistent with [[url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition|AMD]] and caused the failure of the global nav links that nearly slipped into our beta release.

h1. Componentise javascript utilites 
For simple scripts with no dependencies and no reuse cases it can be optimal to include them inline (in the mustache templates).  We currently do this in two places:

    * the newsletter form validation js
    * the js that bootstraps/rewires the pdf viewer markup in order to allow us to change the sidebar orientation

Elsewhere, however, js dependencies are loaded through requirejs.  These scripts should be

 * made into separate github projects, versions dynamically pulled in by a grunt / bower script
 * where the component requires (non-trivial) markup, organise into reusable molecules

This would apply to:

# the carousel
# expanding / collapsing (semantic) component
# toggle show / hide / change component (attribution snippet)
# the search form?
# the map?
# data loading infrastructure components
# custom Europeana js utils (resize, event throttle, scrollTrigger)

Possibly, there could be two ""channels"", one for Classical Music and one for Traditional and Folk Music as these are our two major genres.

Using CRF filters we are  able to select only records that A. Have a direct link to a playable music recording and  B. are  longer than a 30s sample.  The shuffle/random feature would be to choose randomly within these and using a what:""classical music"" or what:""folk music"" parameter to shift between the two possible channels.

The radio would be on its own page and use the same video.js based player we use for the item pages. Possibly customised to show also some basic metadata (title, creator, data provider, rights/license and download/share buttons). 

Similar solutions:
Musopen's radio feature, https://musopen.org/radio/ is where I ""borrowed"" this idea from.

Acceptance criteria:
A technical design (ruby + frontend) and estimate of implementation. The estimate can of course have a margin of error but needs to be along the lines of planning poker values: 1, 2, 3, 5,8, 13, 21 development days.

136997503,853,More gracefully handle videojs errors,"For some videos, the videojs player fails with: ""No compatible source was found for this video"".
Some Google-ing and testing reveals this is likely due to a codec that is incompatible with the plugin, which can happen.

However, we do need some better error handling there to better inform our users.

I was thinking something like this:
https://github.com/dmlap/videojs-errors

Or we can manually solve it, by for instance catching the 4 numerical error codes and catch them with our own error messages.

Suggestion for new error messages:

137087823,854,SPIKE: Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS?,"This is a recommendation that applies to all our pages.

The advice is to walk the line between deferring CSS loading and not getting a Flash of Unstyled Content ""above the fold"".   The advice given here is to:

# use inline styling where possible
# split up css resources between those that style the top of the page and the rest

Both of these advices seem to go against our styleguide approach of serving one monolithic, cacheable css resource.

The scripts mentioned are:

* http://fonts.googleapis.com/…alic,400,700&subset=latin,greek,cyrillic
* http://styleguide.europeana.eu/v/0.2/css/search/screen.css


The font resource can be loaded asynchronously - that part is straightforward.  For the other we may want to check out a javascript approach developed by Google's own pagespeed team, referenced here:

This pertains to styleguide assets hosted on S3, none of which have an expiration specified. These have ETag headers already, but no Cache-Control header.

As styleguide assets are versioned on production, they will never change, and can therefore have a very high value set for max-age in Cache-Control, e.g. Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000 (1 year)

We should also consider the use of [[url:https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/|Cache-Control: immutable]] (see #1994)

137196913,861,Generic (o)embeddable player support,"Collections should be able to embed media from platforms which support the oembed standard.
This should be detected in the initial phase based on the hostname in the WebResource. We should create a mapping of hostnames to oembed endpoints.
More info & spec: http://oembed.com/ (which also includes some libraries we could use)

*Suggestion/sample:*
WebResource URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChuBmH6kkYM

* Collections takes the hostname (without the subdomain, if any) from the URL, in this case: youtube.com
* youtube.com has an oembed endpoint at youtube.com/oembed, which is defined in our mapping
* We pass the WebResource URL to the oembed endpoint
* We use the embed code from the oembed endpoint to embed the media from YouTube
* In case it fails, we fallback to the normal way we would otherwise display this item
(open for a different solution)

At a later stage, our metadata will have an indicator whether the platform supports oembed and what the endpoint is, in that case Collections should be able to do all of this without any configuration or mapping. We are working on a definition for this. As well, as this requires an API call on load, we should investigate whether we can cache the response for an object.

137203883,862,SoundCloud support,"Provide support for objects where the edmIsShownBy is a SoundCloud URN (see http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021613/tracks_48062279.html) and therefore cannot be dealt with in #861.

*Pattern*
urn:soundcloud:id example: urn:soundcloud:48062279 which is in the edm:isshownby of 

This solution is premised on the fact that all these platforms have only one parameter we need to set in order to embed their player. For SoundCloud the embed pattern would be:

<iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/48062279&amp;color=1a8ac7&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false""></iframe> where the track number is the number in the URN.

This URN based solution was used in the old portal for these datasets:
9200251_Ag_EU_TEL_a1200a_British_Library
2059210_Ag_EU_eSOUNDS_1014_NISV
2021613_Ag_NL_DigitaleCollectie_GeluidvanNL

*Acceptance criteria*
* Objects where there is a URN in the edmIsShownBy and a full URL in the hasView should show the embedded code as the SoundCloud oembed provides instead of the thumbnail (example: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021613/tracks_48062279.html), there should just be one player. If a SoundCloud URL is present, this one needs to be used.
* Objects where there is just a URN and no other SoundCloud URL need to use the URN to create the player (example: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200251/BibliographicResource_3000055617801.html).
(Unfortunately we do not have any test objects where the edmIsShownBy is a SoundCloud URL).

More test objects:
http://europeana.eu/portal/search?q=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy:*soundcloud*

*Notes*
* The URN-based pattern was an experiment last year and will most likely be deprecated, however we still should support this as we have objects in our metadata adhering to this format.
* Note that some/most of these objects both have a full URL to the media in their webresources (which is not the case for all), and a URN. We just need to show one as they are the same.

Available themes should always be the themes we have published (in the CMS) selections for. Currently Music and Art History but this must be dynamic, not static. 

Query Filter:

URLs:
The chosen theme should be visible in the URL of the page. Perhaps simply as a &theme=[thematiccollectionslug] that uses the slug from the CMS.

137430213,881,Add other roles than Admin to the portal CMS,"- _Rivised by Michelle 21-11-2016 - _

*User story:* 

- Europeana wants to open up the CMS to partners so they can work on their own collections
- Europeana wants to assign different roles to different users. 

*Current situation:*

Currently there's only the role Admin who is empowered to do everything. We need to add other roles beginning with a role of ""theme editor"" or similar that can edit an existing thematic collection but nor create new ones or edit other thematic collections than their own. There is already a role named ""user"" specified in the CMS but when you try to log in and your role is ""user"", you will get ""forbidden"". 

*The Goal:* 

Create the possibility in the CMS to assign different roles and make these roles function. 

*Suggested user stories* 

- I want to know which roles we need.
- I want to know what each role entails.
- I want to know if the layout of the page changes for each role or if we are working with ""forbidden"" areas.

* An unordered hierarchy is not supposed to show a number, list-wise
* Unordered children should be ordered according to the specifications as written down in #752
* The total number of children should reflect the exact same children as displayed in the hierarchy
* The front-end should reflect what the API outputs in terms of order etc.

*Sample objects:*

139386993,932,SPIKE: Custom facets for Thematic Collections,"This is a two-fold spike to look at the feasibility of faceting on data within the Fashion Collection.

* One is to (temporarily or only) enable the date facet again on the test environment so we can play around with it for the Fashion Collection.
* Two is to investigate the best option to be more flexible when it comes to facets, to allow for:
** Certain facets to be enabled on either all, some or one Thematic Collection.
** Customise the order of facets for all, some or one Thematic Collection.

Something to keep in mind for two is that this is not something that will likely be changed during sprints, from an editor perspective I see no need of adding it to the CMS but perhaps we should add it to some config file.
We don't have to implement it right now but it would be good within the scope of this ticket to agree on a solution to make it more flexible along with a time estimate to implement.

On pushing the app to CF, the Ruby buildpack precompiles these _on each app deployment_, i.e. on web, worker and scheduler separately.

It would be more efficient, i.e. make our deployments faster, to precompile these on the Jenkins server and then push to CF. The Ruby buildpack can detect when assets are precompiled and will use them.

However, it does so by checking for the existence of a compiled asset manifest like public/assets/manifest-$HASH.yml, and for some reason one does not get generated for our app when `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` is run.

Some notes:
* We can let go of Events entirely.
* Blog can be in the same layout and style as we currently have.
* We should find space for Tumblr, technically we will just pull this in from a configurable RSS blog.
* We will migrate the Themes as well: http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themeoverview.html, so this you can use/include

Consider this ticket a proposal based on the current landing page, with the requirements for Fashion in mind.

The current implementation hard-codes the width and height of the image squares (for one breakpoint only) and allows the remaining space to be shared across the columns.

Rather than adding in more hard-coded dimensions and breakpoints it would be optimal to pick up on a technique used in the thumbnails for the carousel on the object page.

The thumbnails here use a (pure css) technique that forces the height of the thumb to be the same as the width.

Proposal:

  * make a new html component ""thumb-square"" that isolates this behaviour
  * retro-fit the new component back into the carousel
  * use the new component in an updated grid display

This will be cleaner code-wise and will allow for a far more fluid resizing, so I'd like to look into it.  If it proves to be too time-consuming or less of a good idea than it seems then I'll limit myself to making sure the grid displays well at all breakpoints using hard-coded dimensions.

Tabindex values of 1 or greater specify an explicit tab/navigation order for page elements. Because it modifies the default tab order, cause confusion, and result in decreased keyboard accessibility, it should be avoided.

If the natural tab order is already logical, remove the tabindex. Otherwise, consider restructuring the page so that tabindex is not needed. If tabindex is maintained, ensure that the resulting navigation is logical and complete.

A tabindex attribute is present and has a positive value.

As two language codes ends up with two codes for 'be'. Collections then can't make a choice/match and displays them all.

Story: As a user I would like to browse Europeana's data by specific license type.
NOTE: These are the facets from the RIGHTS facet.

Implementation:
* Add a line under the ""CAN I USE IT"" facet with: ""Show specific licenses""
* This should show the RIGHTS facet, with some specifics:
** We should show the licenses in a more user-friendly way:
*** Strip http:// & www from the value on display 
*** If a facet has been selected from the ""CAN I USE IT"" facet, we should auto-select and grey out the RIGHTS values that belong to this one (see http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search#reusability-parameter for mapping)
* We should add a question mark/help icon/or something similar to the ""Can I use it"" facet, which links to: /portal/rights.html

In the next iteration we should test whether this improves it enough for users. I'm leaning towards the notion that we also need a better help page explaining what something like ""Yes, with attribution"" actually means. This is evidently not clear enough to some users. Also, we should then investigate whether we can make the licenses even more user friendly in naming and add icons (but given the crap that is in some of our RIGHTS values this seems like a task that needs to wait until we further normalise the data).",2,2016-05-17T07:15:33.000Z,,2016-04-15T09:13:24.000Z,1,-45.0,true,9550883,",b-AqTih9ir5ykEacwqjQWU,cl1v4sh9ir5yotacwqjQWU",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2016-05-17T07:15:33.000Z,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,,cGWssmatmr5kX4acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Search""}",2,,,

145773713,1177,Further improve (and fix) contextual display for agents,"Previously discussed in #832.
This ticket is to further improve the contextual display for agents, as currently we just show wrong values which is why we should fix it rather than wait for improvements in the model to better link contextual classes with their entities.

Example record: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048005/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Nationalmuseum__Sweden_18536.html
This record has two agents, one is a contributor (Anders Zorn) and one is the creator (Alexander Roslin). However, we display the first agent (Anders Zorn) here as creator.

""Current logic for the creator field is to take the first agent's prefLabel if one exists, otherwise the dcCreator, otherwise the proxies.dcCreator""
We should expand and improve this logic. One thing we should do is create a new label called ""Subject"" under ""People"" if dcSubject is an agent.

*Suggested updated description*
For each agent, look for all fields in all proxies (europeanaProxy:true and europeanaProxy:false) and try to match the agent’s about with a URI provided as dcCreator, dcContributor, dcSubject, dcPublisher, dcRights. 
* If no match is found, we should not list “PEOPLE” on the item display page at all. 
* If a match is found: 
** Display in PEOPLE: 
*** The preferred label of the agent(s) in the proper language under the correct label (so either Creator, Contributor, Subject, Publisher, Rights, etc).
*** If there is no preferred label in the proper language, display the English preferred label if it exists
*** If there is no preferred label with a language, display the first preferred label if it exists
*** If there is no preferred label at all, display the first alternative label 
*** If there is no alternative and preferred label at all, display foaf:name
*** If there is no label, show the URI instead
** If one value for a property is found to be an agent and displayed in PEOPLE, we should not display the value under the original field (Subject in CLASSIFICATIONS, Publisher in PROVENANCE, Rights in COPYRIGHT)

*Acceptance criteria*
For record: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048005/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Nationalmuseum__Sweden_18536.html
""Anders Zorn"" should be listed as contributor and ""Alexander Roslin"" as creator. In another language, the localised label should be displayed instead.

Exclude all items if media type = VIDEO, SOUND or 3D. These are not retrievable via IIIF. They will give a HTTP500 if one tries so we can also simply call all but only render if we get a ""positive"" response. But by definition video, sound and 3D are not ""IIIFable"".

Pattern:
For all items the URI to the IIIF-manifest can be derived from dc:identifier. Example:
dc:identifier = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8449047c means that the manifest URI = http://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b8449047c/manifest.json

We should of course ask BNF to include these URIs in the metadata they supply to us (or we add it to our mapping of their data),  but I think it's well-worth doing the quick solution first. Re-ingesting all their data will take awhile.

This ticket is to add these 3 facets to the Europeana Fashion Thematic Collection, but only on the test & acceptance environments for now.

Can we add them for now under ""Can I Use It"" in the facets, in the following order:
* Designer
* Item type
* Technique
* Colour

The logic for each facet, as discussed, will be as follows:
*Designer:* take the labels from the CREATOR facet, and only show labels where the label ends with "" (Designer)"" and where the label is not a URI. Remove the string "" (Designer)"" from the display label.
*Item type:* take the labels from the proxy_dc_type.en facet and only show those which start with ""Object Type: "". Remove the string ""Object Type: "" itself from the display label.
*Technique:* take the labels from the proxy_dc_format.en facet and only show those which start with ""Technique: "". Remove the string ""Technique: "" itself from the display label.
*Colour:* take the labels from the proxy_dc_format.en facet and only show those which start with ""Color: "". Remove the string ""Color: "" itself from the display label.

Note that for all the facets, the search term for the facet remains the same. So when a user selects a designer, the query would be something like ""&qf=CREATOR:Name (Designer)"" with the "" (Designer)"" in it. So we only alter the display of the label.

In the next iterations we should address multilingualism, label improvements and apply filtering on item type is possible.

* Show ""Preview"" and ""Full exhibition"" as part of the chapter navigation below the intro page of a Virtual Exhibition, so we can route a user to either the preview or the full exhibition on a particular subject.

* This change we can then add to Optimizely as a ""Variation"" to the search result page (where one can simply change or add front-end code)
* We should add a tracker (clicks) on the grid & list view options, as well as results per page.
* The audience split should be 50/50.

Despite us adding a 301 redirect on the non-www domain to the www domain, Google Analytics still reports to receive traffic on the non-www domain. We should find out how and solve this.*

Google Analytics says:
<pre><code>Property http://www.europeana.eu is receiving data from redundant hostnames. Some of the redundant hostnames are:
europeana.eu
www.europeana.eu
Redundant hostnames are counted as separate rows in reports, so hits that are going to the same page on your site from different hostnames will be split into multiple rows. With data split across multiple rows, traffic to specific pages will appear lower than it actually is.

To avoid this problem, consider setting up a 301 redirect from one of your redundant hostnames to the other, or create a search-and-replace filter that strips ""www."" from hostnames.
</code></pre>

Since www is in our canonical URLs I suggest we redirect europeana.eu to www.europeana.eu - we need to be careful though so that we don't break anything inadvertently.",4,,,2016-05-31T07:24:25.000Z,1,-623.0,false,7270973,"ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,aisqVAXBWr5BSPdmr6bg7m",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2017-04-03T11:00:17.000Z,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Statistics""}",0,,andyjmaclean@gmail.com,https://s3.amazonaws.com/assembla-avatars/addd83a8/bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw:1422091573

I would like to propose that we SPIKE whether we can on initial page generation only ever request the record itself from the Record API, and then have any and all additional HTTP requests be initiated by the front-end.

149891263,1258,Implement language policy for Collections,"Implementation of #1091.

Google guidelines: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182192?hl=en

*Implementation:*
* All Collections URLs will start http://www.europeana.eu/portal/xy, where xy is a two-letter language code such as ""en"" or ""nl"".
* Requesting a Collections page using a URL with a two-letter language code stores the language in one's session, and displays the page in that language.
* The language menu contains all languages, same as Exhibitions, and will update the users session and reload the page in the new language.
* Requesting a Collections page using a URL without a two-letter language code (as at present), first inspects the session for a language setting and if one is present, redirects to the URL containing that language code. If no language is set in the session, Collections should try to take the language from the users browser. If that cannot be retrieved, the user is redirected to the URL with the site's default language code, ""en"".
* Language codes in the URL take precedence over the session (and will need to update the session).
* Redirects will be handled internally, i.e. by the Collections app and not by Apache, for app-specific session handling and supported language detection.
* Requests for URLs containing unsupported language codes will return a 404, and not attempt to redirect to a supported language.
* To remove the current canonical link in the source, and replace it with:
<link rel=""alternate"" href=""http://example.com/"" hreflang=""x-default"" />
Which should be the non-languaged version.
For each language on each page, we should also include the following link in the source:
<link rel=""alternate"" hreflang=""fr"" href=""http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/"" />
It should refer to the current page at all times but then with another language code.

No changes to be made in the level of the sitemap or API.

*Acceptance criteria:*
* The language indicated in the page URL should always be the same as the language where the page is displayed in. If I'm on http://test.npc.eanadev.org/portal/nl/collections/music then the page should be in Dutch.
* The language menu on the upper right corner should contain all available languages, every language should work and should reload the current page with the new language code in the desired language.
* If you request a page without a language code, eg http://test.npc.eanadev.org/portal/collections/music, on your first visit to the site, i.e. with no locale stored in your session, it should redirect you to a language version based on the locale of your browser.
* If you request a page without a language code on your first visit to the site, and have no preferred language set in your browser, it should redirect you to the English version of the page
* All pages without language URLs should still work and redirect you to a version with a language.
* If you request a page with a non-existent language code, a 404 error should be seen.
* If you open Collections in Swedish, and then open a new tab with a Collections URL without a language code, it should remember your other language and should show the new page in Swedish too. 
* The working of the language dropdown on both Exhibitions and Collections should be consistent.
* If you open Collections in Dutch, and then open a new tab with a Collections URL with a different language code, eg Swedish, it should show that and subsequent pages in Swedish.
* Translating content in the CMS by changing the locale using its drop-down must continue to work
* Every page should have alternate <link> elements in the HTML <head> for each available language, and a default without any language

Please ensure testing is done with various language settings and combinations.",2,2016-07-19T13:54:07.000Z,,2016-06-03T10:35:58.000Z,1,-24.0,true,9909333,",bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,aybbJ63Vur4BxmacwqjQYw",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2016-07-19T13:54:07.000Z,0.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,,cGWssmatmr5kX4acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Multilingual""}",2,,,
149891773,1259,End user blog display in Collections via Wordpress RSS,"*NOTE THAT THIS WILL ONLY BE NEEDED IF SPIKE #1892 CONCLUDES THAT USING THE PRO RSS FEED IS NOT FEASIBLE*

Implement based on SPIKE #1094.

Design/back-end/redirects/alignment end user teams etc.

*Acceptance criteria:*
To make it part of Collections (from a users perspective, so look and feel-wise).

* Show end user blogs inside Europeana Collections - cp. the solution in 14-18 which consumes a Google Blogspot instances feed.
* Use the blog template from the Styleguide/PatternLab
* Have a page with all the end user blogs, paginated, the Blog List
* Each blog has its own 'featured/first' image
* Each blog has categories and tags, such as currently (it should also be possible to filter on tag, a tag which we could use to link it to a Thematic Collection for instance)
* We should keep functionality like social sharing of individual blog posts
* Comments we can live without in the first phase, we might want to add them later. If so, likely via Disqus 

*Implementation suggested in the SPIKE:*
Given that Wordpress supports pagination of RSS feeds, e.g. http://blog.europeana.eu/feed/?paged=2, the simplest approach here is to add a controller to Collections which displays lists of, and individual, blog posts retrieved from the Wordpress RSS feed (and cached in Redis).

URLs would follow the WP convention, i.e. http://blog.europeana.eu/2016/05/mars/ would become http://www.europeana.eu/portal/blog/2016/05/mars/. As Wordpress would remain in place, we would want to redirect its public, non-admin, URLs to Collections.

Advantages of this: little development time (estimated two days), no data migration from Wordpress to another CMS, no development of another CMS, no retraining of bloggers.

Disadvantages of this: any admin preview function would not use the Collections style (unless it is also implemented as a WP theme), different technology stacks for WP and Collections, updates to blog posts would not be updated on Collections immediately.

*Question from David:*
Would it make sense to also in a second SPIKE estimate the effort of migrating to Alchemy? This seems like a bit of a half-measure. Especially since we also need to add support for thematic collection specific events which, if I understand things correctly, simply can't be done in Wordpress but must be done either in the Portal CMS or Alchem

150420623,1277,Allow Java apps to use the styleguide,"@Alena_Fedasenka has been tasked with developing the front-end for METIS and is considering using the styleguide to do so.

We've discussed some aspects of how js and css are developed in the styleguide, but we never got round to discussing the actual templates.

The styleguide uses (logic-less) mustache templates.  When they are added or edited and committed to github an automated task is invoked which generates a ruby Gem that can then be included in the dependencies of a ruby project.  What we need is a similar thing to happen for java - an automated task that builds a jar file containing the templates whenever they are edited in the styleguide repo.

Also needed is a java library that can actually render these templates.

Java apps wanting to use the styleguide would simply import these two jars (the styleguide and the rendering library) and have the controller use them to render the view (instead of using JSP)

Part of this task would be to investigate how templates can be overridden within a java environment.  It's not practical for a front-end developer to have to build a Gem or .jar to test every minor edit, and we avoid this in Collections by allowing the templates in the Gem file to be overridden with local mustache files that can then be developed in situ before making their way into the Gem.",3,2016-07-25T15:03:50.000Z,,2016-06-09T15:36:15.000Z,1,-80.0,false,9990673,"bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,a7Pf3g-R0r4QpcacwqjQXA",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Invalid,0,2016-07-25T15:03:50.000Z,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,"{""Theme""=>""Environment & Architecture""}",0,,,

152102813,1305,SPIKE: Feasibility of logging search interactions,"As part of improving our search, it is essential that we start to log search interactions with the single goal to be able to reconstruct search queries. It has been decided that the current ELK-stack is best fit as a backend for this purpose. However, we do not track the information needed yet for the goal.

In order to do so, at minimum, we would need to log the following:
* The query terms themselves. This is supplied by Rails logging, in messages such as http://bit.ly/23ecCmz
* The number of hits found for the query terms. This isn't available in the logs at the moment - though it is a piece of information Solr supplies by default in its response headers, so acquiring this shouldn't be too difficult.
* The rank position of a clicked item in the Search Results Page. 
* All of this, tied together with some session identifier grouping a users session.

Background, context: https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/172/details?comment=999255843

*Goal of spike*
To investigate whether the Ruby part of the application can facilitate in this logging and would in theory be able to write the minimum required information to the ELK-stack.

152145303,1309,Promo section behaviour on thematic channels,"To better differentiate thematic landing pages from the homepage the promo section (on desktop) will behave a bit differently in the latter.

h3. breakingpoint xxl 
_targets 17""+ screens_

Currently the promo section extends to the maximum width of the screen with xxl breaking point, which in the thematic landing pages doesn't work well because there's the browse entry point section between the promo and the hero, and this creates an odd looking white-space area, making it distracting and overwhelming.
So aligning the promo section with the rest of the content makes the layout much more balanced, and balances the prominence of all the different sections within the thematic landing pages.

h3. breakingpoint med
_targets 10""/8.9"" tablets (e.g. Apple iPad 4 & previous)_

Using collections as an example, all promo boxes//tiles have the same area in this breaking point, and there are 6 items displayed. Currently on thematic channels there's four items with one highlighted (bigger), which breaks the layout, leaving empty spaces.
In this case we should, like in collections, have no highlighted tile and make them all the same size, 2 per row/columns since we only have 4 items and the screen is relatively small.

h3. breakingpoint small-3
_targets 7""/8.3"" tablets_

Given the screen size for this breaking point small-3 we take advantage of verticality and have a tile ocupying the whole row. This will also make more use of the promo images.  (this should also be applied collections in my opinion)

Implementation:

* The Europeana Blacklight adapter would need to be adapter to work with the JSON-LD response format. (Not to replace its handling of the JSON one, but extended to support either.)
* The portal's record page would need to be heavily refactored to work against the JSON-LD response.

153779853,1343,Disable reuse on Apache ProxyPass directives,"On 10th July 2016, the acceptance site was noted (by @remygardien) to have started displaying some other website not associated with Europeana.

This issue only affected it if accessed through the Apache reverse proxy. If accessed at the portal app's URL directly, it showed up as expected.

The CNAME record for acceptance Apache was confirmed to be correct, pointing to Pivotal's SSL service, as do test and production.

Restarting the acceptance Apache (by @cskodras) fixed the issue, leading us to speculate that this is (something like) an internal Apache DNS/route caching issue.

To prevent this issue recurring in future, potentially on production, it is proposed that all of the ProxyPass directives in Apache should set disablereuse=on.

I suggest 4 changes:

154999373,1367,Labelling of exhibitions in the foyer very inconsistent and thus confusing to users,"Referring to http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer

So what do I find inconsistent? The mix of labels that refer to themes (e.g. Art History), domains (libraries), names of microsites (Europeana 1914-1918) and names of specific partners (Hallwylska). I would suggest it should always be themes. And actually it has been decided in the past that all exhibitions are to be matched to themes! I don't believe that has changed.

Faces of Europe should be Art History. Put the chapter number in the title. The chapter number should also be in the <title> and page URL. Having both http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/revolution-and-war and http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe/revolution-and-war is poor SEO and URL-structure.

Europeana 1914-1918 should be First World War.

Darwinism... should be Natural History rather than History (more specific and also a potential future channel).

Royal Book Collections should be Art History. Possibly History of Literature but the exhibiton focuses more on the art aspect of illuminated manuscript than the literature aspect.

Pablo Picasso should be Art History

European Film Gateway should not be a label, the label for their exhibition should be First World War.

The wiki ones I'd label Architecture

The sport one I'd label History or possibly History of Sport

The Biodiversity Heritage Library ones should all be Natural History

Trip to Egypt is tricky but I'd put it in Photography (as this will be a future channel). One could also do that one and the TEL travel exhibition as Travel History.

The European Library ones would in order be:
History, History of Science, History, Art History, Architecture and History. The TEL exhibition Reading Europe is missing entirely and should be included - it's their flagship exhibition, I'd label it History of Literature and so should also the Book 1514-2014 exhibition be. *NOTE*: As far as I know all TEL exhibitions will be shut down at the end of the year. The only exhibition there's talk about saving is Reading Europe. Note this is not my decision, that's for Nienke/Uldis/Adrian to decide (but note that there are no development resources for this, they'd have to migrate Reading Europe and others to the new CMS manually).

Athena to Art History or possibly, Religion

EUScreen I'd label History of Television

155066083,1381,Data provider logo upload for selected providers,"This is to pilot the upload of data provider logos for Europeana Fashion.
The scope of this ticket is to allow a CMS user to upload provider logos that belong to a Europeana Fashion provider.

Providers & information:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RaqIo1dmZg9CSKRyLSMoJIJaNP_Uwk0t7lemNB8iLUg/edit#gid=0

As a CMS user I should have the option to upload one file, and associate this with a provider name.
We should store the logos with a reference to the provider identifier, indicated in column C.
Also, Collections should be aware that 000001 is ""Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision"" etc., in order to power the display (on record pages) at a later point in time.

Upload form could look like:
* Select provider [dropdown with the providers from the spreadsheet]
* Upload image [with notes: minimum 300px in width, transparent & greyscale]

Implementation notes:
* Image to be stored in a S3 bucket with the identifier of the provider.
* Image to be resized to 300px width (relatively resized) if larger than 300px.
* Original image saved as something like [identifier]_original
* The CMS should also throw an error message if the image is below 300px in width.

*Long-term strategy:*
Provider information such as logo etc. will become part of the API. At that point we will replace the dropdown list with a listing that comes from the API. Provider logo upload will remain to take place within Europeana Collections. At that point we also shouldn't need to store the provider name anymore as there is a provider identifier in the record which allows us to display the logo.",3,2016-09-30T14:37:48.000Z,,2016-07-22T09:16:15.000Z,1,-27.5,true,10087873,",bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,aybbJ63Vur4BxmacwqjQYw,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2016-09-30T14:37:48.000Z,0.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,,cGWssmatmr5kX4acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Environment & Architecture""}",2,,,

155695083,1415,DESIGN: Item display structure,"Our item display needs some rework, as we are adding more and more to it and also plan to add even more to it in the near future. We should work on/test/iterate on an updated information architecture for the item display, which is the scope of this ticket.

Things we need to add to the item display:
* Show the planned new ways for the user to navigate from an item page to curated content
** Specifically: Item to Galleries, Item to Blog posts, Item to Exhibitions, Items to Entity pages, Items to Thematic collections, 
* Try to increase conversion by more prominent display of similar items and other navigational pathways to content (esp. curated content - see bullet above)
* User annotations incl. actions to add them
* Data provider logos (DONE, but needs to be taken into account)
* User contributed stories (14-18) - design challenges: Custom display? Or folded into a generic item display? 
* Improved/reviewed display of related items. As in related in the metadata, like for the [[url:http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200384/BibliographicResource_3000117070235.html|newspapers issues series]]
* Improved/reviewed display of information that ties in with the media (colours, image metadata, technical metadata).
* Trying to not overwhelm casual users with too much metadata while showing professional users full metadata (this could e.g. be by not showing all metadata at once by default but let that setting be cookie based so that users who like to see all metadata can have that as the default)
* Accommodate a fairly large amounts of calls to actions while _featuring_ only a few. Apart from currently available actions we have a number of planned actions to add/review: Download/View metadata, My Europeana (Save item, Save search, Create gallery/set), Embed

*Notes*
While there is not a coherent/complete item design proposal with all of the aspects above many of them exist in simple wireframe form as they were part of the initial design efforts that preceded and paralleled the development of Europeana Collections. These designs are in Invision. While they don't need to be followed they should be reviewed and wheels that don't need redesign should not.

* Editorial: Update the facet label to ""Date created"" instead of ""Date"".
* Add a ""Filter"" button next to it, as currently the only way to submit the text input is to press the enter button.
* We should show the date filter in the facets below the search box, so users can unclick their selections easily. ""DATE CREATED: 1900-1920"" it should become.
* See if its possible to add a middle value to the scale, to give users a better sense of the scale of the date range.

*Bugs that need to be fixed on the current facet:*
* If you do a ranged search, your values aren't retained.
* On tablets and phones the date range area exceeds the facet area.

*Later iterations:*
* Consider moving the date facet, or a part of it, to the top of the page, in more of a timeline view with the possibility to select a time range (similar to DigitalNZ's implementation, see #983).
* Food for thought/idea: we could also go for a more facet-like date facet with grouped periods, but then these periods should adapt to the content.

155776993,1425,VIRTUAL EXHIBTIONS: Redirection of the Gallery and Foyer,"

1. As a user I want to be directed to the new exhibitions voyer (http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer) at all times. 
2. As a super-admin user I still need to have access to the old exhibtion-gallery (http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/) 
3. As a user I still want to be able to land directly on exhibitions in the old foyer via (e.g.) Google or old blogposts.

*Problem:*
The old exhibtions voyer (http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/) is still an active landing space for Europeana users, although we have the new exhibitions in place. We would like all users to land on the new voyer (http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer) , but (for editorial purposes) we still need the old Gallery to be available for Europeana personell. I hope that this will not intervene with people who come directly to exhibitions on the old platform via Google or when the link is given in a blogpost or something.  

*Solution:* 
Redirect users to the new voyer, but keep the old voyer available for Europeana and keep all exhibitions that are on  http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/... still available. 

*Acceptance criteria:*
- I want http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/ to redirect to http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer
- I want http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/ content to still be available somewhere only Europeana staff can access.
- I want all direct links to keep working so (e.g.) http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/past-not-as-you-know still needs to work. 

Please propose the way to do this in the ticket comments.

155777053,1426,UI/Visual design of a gallery feature,"*Problem:* 
The Europeana Fashion portal will be closed soon and all of the content in their portal should be migrated to the fashion Collection here at Europeana. Currently they also have something called ""themes"" in there. These themes are very small exhibitions or very image heavy blogposts which makes them both unsuitable for the Virtual Exhibitions here at Europeana as well as the Blog. 

Europeana has however played around with the idea of creating Galleries for a long time now and this might be the perfect opportunity to start working on a platform here that supports these Galleries. This however does impose a time constraint. All of the themes in the Europeana Fashion Portal ( see http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themeoverview.html ) need to be migrated to the new gallery platform before the end of February. We are looking for the easiest / quickest way to whip something up, but that is also of use for other Collections. Currently VEs doesn't have a ""building block"" to support multiple images and ""galleries"" are also not supported in the CMS.  

*The solution we had in mind:*

- Use  Alchemy as the CMS for editors to create the Galleries
- We need a Galleries foyer page with the same design as the exhibitions foyer where each gallery is represented by a tile. The tile design should differ from the exhibition tile design so that they are distinguishable from each other. I would suggest the Gallery tile looks a bit like a Pinterest board card i.e. it shows visually that there are multiple images in the gallery. See attached image.
- The Gallery foyer and individual galleries to be available under the Explore menu option
- The editor must be able to add a title for the gallery. The CMS should ensure it is unique by appending a number if necessary 
- The editor must be able to add a max 280 characters long description per gallery
- The editor must be able to add up to 24 images to a gallery. The max number should be in a config file for easy modification.
- We want the design to support credits per gallery image: Title, Creator, Creation date, Data provider, Rights value/icons, Link to item in Collections. Note that these are exactly the same as the credits on a Collections hero image and Exhibition items. Metadata can be added by the editor, or as a nice to have, be fetched via the Europeana API by the editor supplying the item link.
- The following actions must be available per image in the gallery slideshow: Social share (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest), Download, Zoom in, Full screen, Paginate left and right

_Nice to haves:_
- The gallery images should have og and Twitter card markup so that we can control
- The editor should have the ability to add an image caption freetext of up to 280 characters.
- For images from a data provider for which we have a logo the logo is automatically included in the display


*Notes/suggestion:*
- For a first implementation of the gallery slideshow why not keep things simple and just use the image viewer component as we do for images in Collections. Photoswipe, http://photoswipe.com/ It has basically all the display features that the acceptance criteria requires and also comes with responsiveness, swipe and keyboard controls for accessibility as well as Schema.org markup, etc. Would also add a measure of consistency of user experience.
- While a different JS-library (https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightgallery.js/) I means smth like the slideshow Collections Trust use for the Europeana images they pull in, http://collectionstrust.org.uk/cultural-property-advice/ (click any of the images in the top band). See also attached annotated screenshot.

*Why not replicate the Fashion themes 1:1 ?*
Because as  they are implemented they make very poor use of 
1. the fact their images are and 
2. forces the user into a user journey like this:
click to theme-click item-enlarge image-click to close image lightbox, click back to theme, click item, enlarge image, close image lightbox, back click, ... And repeat ad nauseam. Way too many clicks!

155862463,1431,SPIKE: Use the Search/REST API to do user management in Collections,"See epic description for more context.

The MyEuropeana/OAuth API functionality is in a state where we can start using it in Europeana Collections.
One of the first use-cases would be to use it for users to create annotations (aside from allowing users to login, register etc.).

This spike is to take a look at the current MyEuropeana methods and flow and see if this is sufficient for the use-cases provided.
I'm also thinking of integrating the CMS login with MyEuropeana, as users have a role in the API we could allow users with role ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR to login to the CMS.

Documentation for OAuth/logging in on behalf of a user:
http://labs.europeana.eu/api/authentication

MyEuropeana methods:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dGbqaSDNduZmQj3ebE-pzBIUAli8OcvZtAZs75GQp8w/edit#

Changes that are pending in the API team:
* Make sure the GET /admin/user/* call also returns the ""role"" value/information for the user.
* Ensure that a TRUSTED CLIENT such as Europeana Collections gets a special role, so that users who login to Collections are bypassing the ""do you allow Collections to authorize your account [..]"".

*Acceptance criteria*

Note that the functionality of searching for annotations based on the generator is available in test but not yet on production, it will be in the course of this sprint though.

*Retrieve annotations on item page*

GET /search?query=*:*&qf=generator_name:""Europeana.eu""&qf=target_id:""/xxx/yyy""&wskey=xxx
(where XXX is and /xxx/yyy is the Europeana record ID and xxx is the public key).

Then, for each URI in the output, the individual annotation needs to be retrieved:
GET /api/annotations/webanno/xxx?wskey=xxx

Example of a test annotation which should be visible on test:
http://www.europeana.eu/api/annotations/collections/66?wskey=apidemo

*Display on the item page*
If annotations are retrieved, we should display the tags on Collections.
Above ""Provenance"", create a new block called ""Annotations"", with a question mark icon next to it leading to /portal/annotations.html.
Within this block, show the annotations as follows:

""Relations: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21257918""

156197893,1445,Spike: Setting up better Exhibitions Test Environment,"Problem:
What is currently the Exhibitions Test Environment seems to be split up over two sites:
http://exhibitions-test.cfapps.io which is not directly linked to the Collections Test environment
and
http://test.npc.eanadev.org/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer which can be accessed from the Colections Test Environment Landing Page.

Both of these have limited use. They do not allow you to do everything that you are expected to be able to do on for example the Prod Environment.
It would be nice if we could capture them both under one URL that can be accessed from the Collections Test Environment, managed from the Exhibitions Test CMS and respond as we expect the Prod Environment to respond.

Analysis:
I had a look together with Christos in the Page Source of the Collections Landing Page on Test
We saw that the URLs for the Exhibitions point to Prod (Except for the very top one, which seem to point to some sort of Exhibitions Page).
So it looks that in the code for the Collections Landing Page on Test some changes have to be made to make them point to correct URLs

Solution:
I don't know what URL's they should point to. So that has to be specified by someone else.
The CMS has to be taken in consideration to, since the Test Exhibitons are managed through this CMS:

156928833,1464,SPIKE: Refactoring & consolidation Statistics Dashboard,"In 2017 the Statistics Dashboard will need to be enhanced with additional functionality. Before we do this we would need to improve the foundation of the application and consolidate it within the Europeana processes and infrastructure.

This spike is to assess the required efforts in order to do so, including but not limited to:
* Code refactoring: adhering to our own code conventions and standards.
* PaaS compatibility: make it compatible to be a PaaS application in a CloudFoundry set-up.
* Infrastructure: migrate it to our CloudFoundry hosting provider.
* Infrastructure: hook it up with Jenkins and all our other tools to get the same deployment and work procedures as we have with our other applications.
* Test and acceptance environments

This spike should be timeboxed to probably a day (half a day from each Ruby dev.) to come up with a list of tasks to do with estimated efforts. A task such as code refactoring might be worthwhile to timebox to let's say 1 or 2 sprints in your estimates. Based on this we can then plan this work accordingly and complete it before we start adding features in the next year.

Specific refactoring tasks identified during this spike [marked with a tick are tasks done in the big-refactor branch]:
* switch the $redis global var for proper use of Rails.cache
* ✔ don't require a tmp dir relative to the app_dir in the puma config - refactor how puma is configured
* update styleguide usage
* ✔ namespace it, i.e. Europeana::Statistics
* stop using idiosyncratic mechanisms where Rails has conventions that would serve just as well, e.g. in db seeding
* update the seeds and instructions for setting the app up for the first time
* ✔ log to ELK via europeana-logging
* nice error pages
* make the code comply with our style. `rubocop -a` will do much of this automatically
* check whether all Rails frameworks are used; if some are not, remove those from the app load
* ✔ ditch the ""staging"" environment config (our staging environments use production environment config, to better reflect its ecosystem)
* implement password strength checking beyond setting an array named ""STUPID_PASSWORDS""
* use ActiveJob with Sidekiq adapter, not Sidekiq directly
* ✔ empty bin/

*Problem:*
Currently there is a lot of static content in the Exhibitions Voyer. The only time something changes is when we add a new exhibition which is usually every three months or so. 
This causes the page to be very static and there is no engagement on the page. 

*Solution:*
Create three blocks in the voyer to feature ""mini exhibtions"" or ""Daily digests"". These are very small exhibitions (one page tops) or XL blogposts that revolve around a minimum of content but still give the user a nice story to read. 

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

The scope of this ticket is only for the voyer. The CMS already allows creation of the XL-posts or Mini exhibitions so we only need space in the foyer to showcase them. 

- I want to see a design that features these ""browse entry points""
- I want to see these browse entry points working in the voyer. 
- I want to see a corresponding ""folder"" in the CMS where we can place these Daily Digests

157134393,1474,Collections: Support for display and creation of (selected) annotations via MyEuropeana,"To allow users to view previously made annotations and to create new annotations via the Annotations API.

h3. Display Wikidata annotations in Europeana 
The first thing we could do is to get annotations to display in Europeana. The [[url:https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/35/details|Wikidata experiment]] seems the perfect candidate for this. No additional work for this is needed on the Annotations API and the benefit is that Collections can already start exploring how to connect with a different API and pull in annotations. We probably shouldn't label them as such as that would imply to users that they can add annotations themselves.

Tasks:
* Collections to hook-up with the Annotations API.
* Collections to do a search for annotations created by Europeana tools.
* Collections to retrieve all individual annotations and render them accordingly.

Timeframe: September 2016

h3. Collect music genres in the Music Collections 
Once we have established the connection with the Annotations API the next step is to allow our users to annotate. For this, we can do a very specific subset of data to allow us to do some experimentation and iterations on the functionality.

Flow to annotate:
* On all item pages which items which are either from the provider ""Europeana Sounds"" or are known to be retrieved via the Music Collections (breadcrumbs), we show the ability for a user to specify or enhance the music genre.
* We show the user a dropdown or a search input box (depending on the solution) to select or search a music genre, and add this as an annotation to the item.
* When a user wants to do so, he or she has to login with a MyEuropeana account first.

Tasks:
* Display music genres on the item page via an API call. We could display them somewhere along in the metadata in a new Annotations section for instance, as there will just be a few.
Allowing users to login via MyEuropeana on Collections. We should probably make these pages only accessible via the annotations feature, as these will be the only ones where a login is needed for.
* Show users either a dropdown with genres, or a search box with genres. Question is: which (API) query can Collections make to retrieve the labels?
* Collections creates the annotation via the Annotations API on behalf of the users' token from MyEuropeana.

157135253,1476,Collections: Entity functionality based on Entity API,"For Collections to exploit the functionality from the [[url:test-entity.europeana.eu/docs/|Entity API]], in order to improve and enrich the search experience and offer new ways for users to discover Europeana's content.

h3. Autosuggest
The first priority would be to exploit the autosuggest functionality to power autosuggests in Europeana Collections. Europeana Collections should, upon a user typing in something in the search box, show and render a list of Europeana entities. Clicking such an entity would trigger a search based on the entity selected. Although the API is functional at this point work still needs to happen on adding all Europeana entities to our Solr search index, work which will happen over October.

Tasks:
* Create a Ruby gem for the Entity API.
* Adapt the search input box to trigger the suggest API to suggest entities.
* Adapt the search results page to trigger an entity specific search when an entity has been selected.
(as a sidetrack, and until October, we are working on user testing to determine how such a suggest functionality should look like and work)

Timeframe: November.

h3. Entity facets and filters
When the reindexing work has been completed we should show our users entity facets, for entities as topics, persons and places. These will be based on existing facets.

Timeframe: December

h3. Knowledge cards
When a user searches for an entity, Collections should show a so called ""knowledge card"" with more detailed information about the entity.

Wireframe: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/53772101/preview

h3. Entity pages

157425343,1490,TECHNICAL DESIGN: Specify the syntax and response of the Newspaper API,"This story represents defining the conceptual technical design of the Newspaper API and the specification of it. Based on the specificatio n user stories and user story acceptance criteria will be defined.

*Acceptance criteria*
The following should be covered in the specification:

* Requests and Responses
** Authorisation
** Mandatory request parameters
** Header information
** Content negotiation rules
** Supported formats (=only JSON(-LD)) but with links to METS-ALTO

* Base methods for Newspaper
** Retrieve a list of Newspaper titles (IIIF Collection as response format)
** Retrieve an issue list of a Newspaper title (IIIF Collection as response format)
** Retrieve a known Newspaper issue (IIIF Manifest as response format)

* Discovery methods for Newspapers
** Search across multiple titles
** Search within a title
** Search within an issue
** Hit highlighting
** Faceting (Title, Data provider, Language, Date)
** Sorting (Relevancy, Alphabetical  by Title, Chronologically by issue date)

* Error handling

*Big decision*
Should the Newspaper API be its own endpoint? Or should we try to make Newspapers part of the existing Search API as a specific profile?

*Notes/ideas*
* The capabilities of the API will be driven by the planned functionality of the thematic Newspaper Collection. See #1397, #1398 and its children, #1399 , #1400 and its children, #1405 , #1407 , and #1411. 
* Base it on Swagger API definitions from the start rather than writing in a Google Doc. This will force us to do a good structured definition and we will get a Swagger  API console out of it as well. @yorgos.mamakis@kb.nl can advise otherwise on how to markup Java code from start to make sure Swagger consoles are easily generated.
* Otherwise the [[url:https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Rw_qlSpINxztGpI5sM6NcXhnQeZkW3hRA1IYjFtE1w/edit?usp=sharing|Entity Collection API spec]] could serve as a template if we want to spec the API in a GoogleDoc,

* ✔ Monitor and tailor memory & disk allocation of each app role
* ✔ JSON logging
* ✔ Check that deployments do not interrupt broadcasting
* ✔ Stress test the radio station

As a Virtual Exhibition creator, I would like to duplicate exhibitions to multiple languages. 
As a Virtual Exhibtions creator, I would like to be able to duplicate the voyer. 

*Problem:* 

As a VEC (virtual exhibitions creator) I cannot copy entire pages, just their elements. This is causing me to do a lot of manual labour when (e.g.) I want to copy an entire page. There is a copy-ing option in the Alchemy interface, but only for single elements, not ALL elements. This reflects in me having to copy every single element manually.

Make the entire page (or all elements that make up the page) able to be copied in one single click.

161136643,1560,VIRTUAL EXHIBITIONS: Sharing draft exhibitions but not publishing them. ,"_THIS TICKET IS A CLONE OF TICKET: 1435_ 

*User story:*

As an Exhibition editor I would like to be able to share my draft Exhibition in order for others to give feedback without the need for a CMS login.

*Problem*

Currently it's not possible to view an exhibition without publishing it. Since we want partners to make their own exhibitions, or share with partners what their exhibitions would look like online, we need to figure out how to work on this. It should be possible for an editor to save an Exhibition in draft, thus not making it show up on the foyer/overview/Collections menu, but still allow for the editor to share the draft Exhibition via its direct URL. You can now publish an exhibition in the live environment without it showing up in the voyer, but the header dropdown will still show it. 

*Solution:* 

Make the exhibition viewable without it showing up in the navigation in the live environment. 

*Acceptance criteria*

- I want to be able to view an exhibition via an URL without it showing up in any navigation within the Europeana live-environment 
- Or: when i publish an exhibition without clicking the eye-icon, I want it to not show up in the header drop-down or any other navigation in the live environment.

*How to test this:*

* This is an upgrade to the current grid display.
* The grid should be vertically asymmetrical, and fit in 3 columns.
* We stick with the idea of 'cards'.
* The height of the card has to be relative to how much width of the thumbnail can fit into the width of the card.
* New is that we also show the creator, we should have the same logic here as for the list views creators.

This ticket is to change that facet to YEAR instead (&facet=YEAR), and to change the facet limit from 10,000 back to 1,000 (currently there are 500+ values for Fashion). Also, we need to change our logic to strip out only values which are more than 4 digits (with or without the ""-"" prefix for BC dates), as we have a few years which are 8-digit numbers. I've contacted our data provider to fix these issues.

For now, this seems like a better approach for the first version of the date facet than using proxy_dcterms_created.

162807433,1584,As an editor of a Europeana exhibition I want to be able to include hi-res zoomable images in my exhibition...,"...too my users delight.

*Acceptance criteria:*
- An editor must be able to upload a hi-res TIFF or JPG and request it to be made zoomable (by e.g. clicking in an option in the image upload dialogue of the Exhibitions CMS). If the image is smaller than 4 megapixels (cutoff to be defined in a config file so we can easily change it) the editor should get a response saying that the image is too low resolution. In Alchemy terms Zoomable image will be a new type of Element.
- An editor must be able to put in place the zoomable image Element in an exhibition page, just as they can do with a regular image
- A user must be able to view, zoom in, pan and go full screen in the image as included in an exhibition

*Technical notes:*
- The backend must be the Europeana Image Service, https://confluence.man.poznan.pl/community/display/ECLOUD/Image+Service and thus has a dependency on that service
- The viewer should be a stripped down version of IIIF Leaflet. By stripped down, is meant that it must have two visual controls only: Zoom in/out and Full screen (see the V&A example below), the pagination controls are not needed. Keyboard and Pinch controls for zoom and pan are very needed, but don't need visual controls.
- There are a number of libraries, Ruby specifically, that may be of aid in not having to invent entire wheels, worth checking out: https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif

1. As a user; I would like to see a voyer filled with exhibtions.

*Problem:* 
Currently the hero image in the exhibtions voyer (see http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer) is taking up the entire top of the screen. 
Users have identified that this is confusing because they don't know that they need to scroll down in order to see more exibitions. 
The developed versions are really not close to the mockup by Carlos. Nor the live version. 

*Solution:* 
Decrease the size of the hero image in the voyer so that it is clear that there is more underneath. 
The hero image needs to be smaller than full width. Add some padding on the sides (white space). The image should be a bit bigger or equal to the column size of the featured boxes.

See design for this here: https://invis.io/SD5MY3XEC#/153654564_Exhibitions_Foyer_Dir

The business motivation is that we want to make the Newspapers content as technically and legally available for academic research as possibly can be.

* All metadata records must be CC0. If  for a dataset they are not, then the dataset will not be accepted as part of the Europeana Newspapers corpus.
* Freetext and imagery must be copyright marked using edm:rights statements
* Public Domain marked and CC-licensed freetexts and imagery will be prioritised over those that are not

*Tech:*
Technically, we wish to support this via the Europeana Cloud infrastructure. 

*Tasks outlined:*
To do that the following task will need to be completed:

- Load the metadata into eCloud, attached to the same eCloud Records as the images and full texts.
- Identify the rights for all collections (for metadata and for fulltext)
- Add the rights information to the metadata in eCloud
- Setup in eCloud the access control mechanisms according to the rights (if needed at all - I don't think it is)

163243533,1607,VIRTUAL EXHIBITIONS; SPIKE: Creating super-files in Omeka ,"*User Story:* 

Collections is migrating VEs from Omeka to Alchemy. 

*Problem:* 

Currently the Omeka platform does not support an automatic export that supports both the metadata and the files into one “super-file”. They can download the files manually and copy paste the meta data separately and then put them in one file, but the process is dreadful and labour intensive. (Total amount of items in the old exhibitions is over 1100 items.) 

*What to investigate:* 

Is there a way to make Omeka create a super-file (metadata+items) in one click? (Or at least less clicks) and does something like this http://omeka.org/forums-legacy/topic/exporting-batch-metadata-to-xml provide a solution for this problem?

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I want to know if there is a solution for this problem. 
- I want to know how much resources (time) it will take to implement suggested solution(s). 
- I want to know what it means for Collections when the suggested solution is implemented. (basically some rough instructions :) )

163280383,1608,Ability to add images on static pages through collections CMS,"Currently the only way to add an image to a static page is via css, and reference that image from somewhere within the image folder on /source.

This wasn't something that was ever needed until the creation of the OPUS static page, where the image of the record was intended to appear within the text.

An ideal and user-friendly solution would be to have the option in the CMS to upload an image and add it somewhere in the body of the page.",4,,,2016-10-07T12:46:42.000Z,1,-485.0,true,7270973,cl1v4sh9ir5yotacwqjQWU,ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2016-10-07T12:46:42.000Z,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,cl1v4sh9ir5yotacwqjQWU,"{""Theme""=>""Search""}",2,,,
163305143,1609,Allow images to be uploaded and referenced directly in the CMS,"Getting images into static pages is not straightforward.  Markup like this:

<pre><code>  <img src=""http://absolute/path/to/styleguide/image.jpg""/>

</code></pre>
is not suitable, because it makes a reference to a specific version of the styleguide that may be deprecated.

Markup like this:

<pre><code>  <img src=""../../relative/path/to/styleguide/image.jpg""/>

</code></pre>

is not suitable either, because relative links in markup resolve relative to where the markup is served from (the application server) not where the images actually reside (the styleguide server)

The solution used [[url:https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-npc/tickets/1518/|here]] follows the technique used for the Europeana logo: it uses a background image defined in the CSS.  This works because relative paths in CSS are resolved relative to the stylesheet, not the app server, and so the div added in the CMS with the class ""opus-img"" corresponds to a CSS rule that gives it the background image ""europeana_opus.png""

A limitation of this approach is that background images do not influence the size of the element they style, so in order to give this image dimension and maintain its aspect ratio the technique described here is used:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/600743/how-to-get-div-height-to-auto-adjust-to-background-size

This is not ideal.  Styleguide updates are necessary in order to add new images, and calculations are required in order to maintain aspect ratios.

Proposal: allow images to be uploaded and referenced directly in the CMS

Technology spike and choice revisited:
* Much of the below features would come ""for free"" if we would adopt the Universal Viewer.

Usability improvements:
* Controls aren't displayed in the fullscreen mode, ensure it does
* Add a tooltip that points out and explains the keyboard controls
* Modify so that when an item loads the viewer is already zoomed in and allowed to take a larger part of the screen real estate, cp e.g. with the Rijksmuseum item page display

Feature additions:
* Display to the user the IIIF-manifest/image URI and make it possible for them to drag and drop it into another viewer (that supports drag and drop), see https://medium.com/@aeschylus/create-and-share-iiif-items-quickly-and-easily-with-drag-and-drop-over-email-879f13c9caba#.xzbdv7im6

164812283,1651,IDEA: Publish virtual exhibitions as IIIF Collections with Manifests,"Our virtual exhibitions are great but there is no way to programmatically access the objects featured in them (or the curatorial text). This idea would make that possible (perhaps minus the curatorial text).

The suggestion would be that every virtual exhibition would be published also as an IIIF Collection with each of the objects (at least images, audio and video would need to wait for IxIF) and their metadata as IIIF Manifests within the Collection.

We could even make one IIIF Collection that contains the individual exhibitions IIIF Collections (collections can be nested).

I could see a couple of ways to do this:
1. The Alchemy CMS is developed to just do it automatically per exhibition.
2. A separate script is created that a developer can run and create and publish a IIIF Collection
3. They are manually created in a tool, e.g. https://github.com/bodleian/iiif-manifest-editor

To test whether there is actually demand for exhibitions IIIF collections we could create 1 or 2 with the IIIF Manifest Editor first. If they're popular we can then try to automate.

Before this is worthwhile we should of course support IIIF zoomable hi-res images in the exhibitions in the first place, see #1584",3,,,2016-10-20T09:20:01.000Z,1,-492.0,false,7270973,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2016-10-20T09:20:34.000Z,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""Rich media access""}",3,,,

164962813,1660,Virtual exhibitions: BUG: Credits ,"*User story:
*
As a user I would like to view the credits on Europeana so I know where stuff comes from. 

*Problem:* 

Currently the credits on the intro image for each chapter overlap. (example: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/sketches-by-david-ring-accessories#ve-anchor-intro_6269-js ) It seems to be that the credits for the last item on the page, display in overlay on the first images's credits. I think it might have to do with the fact that the last image in the example is an ""intro"" too. 

*Solution:* 

Make the image credits of the last image display correctly.

- I want to see all images displayed with their correct credits in the section of the page where the image is featured.

165033993,1661,BUG: Rendering IIIF manifests where canvases have identical labels,"We have found a problem with viewing some IIIF resources, like
http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055020174.html

It seems that the problem happens when IIIF manifests have canvases with identical labels, such as this one, where all canvases have the same label (“NP”):
http://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b6000107x/manifest.json

A simple Leaflet rendering is

When loading in another IIIF viewer (Universal Viewer) the problem does not appear:
http://universalviewer.io/examples/?manifest=http://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b6000107x/manifest.json

Here’s another case, where only a subset of canvases have the same label:
http://styleguide.europeana.eu/patterns/molecules-components-iiif/molecules-components-iiif.html?manifestUrl=http://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b55005728g/manifest.json vs http://universalviewer.io/examples/?manifest=http://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b55005728g/manifest.json

In this example the ToC / order or pages is not the same as specified in the manifest. There are several canvases with “NP” label at the beginning, which may well have disappeared.

165330323,1689,SPIKE: Best way to represent stories/items,"Based on input from #1803, to create an improved version addressing this spike.

--
Europeana 1914-18 has items which are 'stories', and are basically hierarchically structured items with one parent record and a list of child records. A good example is a diary such as this one: 
http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/96
This shows up in search as follows:
http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?q=Feldpostkorrespondenz+Familie+Ramke%2FGramm&qf%5Bindex%5D%5B%5D=a&utf8=%E2%9C%93

In Europeana, currently, this 'story' would show up in search as follows:
https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=Feldpostkorrespondenz+Familie+Ramke%2FGramm
81 search results, of which one is the parent item (without thumbnail) and 80 are the children.

This spike is to figure out what is the best way to represent these stories in Europeana, with the following goals:
* A story should ideally be one search result in the search results, and not 81 in this examples case.
* A story should be browsable as a story, from the first to the last image.
* As each item in the story can have its own item metadata, it should be possible to view this metadata per (child) item.
* It should be made clear in the interface that items belong to a certain story.

As part of #1684 and of this ticket we should as a first step sketch the design - starting with lo-fi paper sketches and then iterate towards higher fidelity - the item display for these 14-18 stories. Which fields show up where and what does the media experience look like and so on. In parallell, as part of the test phase of iterating the designs, we need to investigate how we structure the relationship between the records so that only one comes up in search (and we need to ensure it has a thumbnail and proper title as well).

Ideas that could work here: IIIF Collection/manifest for the parent item so that one allows browsing all images, but separate objects via the hierarchical display for those who want to view detailed metadata for individual (child) items. OR model all items as WebResources of the parent, but then we'd loss some metadata of the items themselves.

@DavidHaskiya IIIF will also enable the representation of the recto/verso of a same item that are currently represented as 2 separate items.

*Functional and UI:*
* Research different options of presenting federated search, leading up to one recommendation. Note that as part of the initial Collections design and development a first MVP interaction was defined by Dean and David along with this medium fidelity wireframe: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/88423399/preview
* The user should be able to turn on federated search and which federated sources (this will require a search settings page)
* A Collections CMS Admin must be able to define default filters for federated sources per theme
* Research other sites that offer federated search, beyond 14-18, take our learnings.

*Technical:*
* A federated search is a search within another search provider. They must be possible to have a pre-defined query filter per thematic collection (configurable by an Admin).
* One Ruby gem for all fed sources or one per source? What did we do in 14-18?
* How do we best represent the mapping from source to EDM? As we did in 14-18?
* Consider performance/loading time. Hypothesis: Lazy load/AJAX federated results

* DPLA
* Trove
* DigitalNZ
* Canadiana (nice to have)

165423453,1693,SPIKE: Migration of annotations from 14-18 to Annotations API,"To Annotations API, from 14-18.

Based on current annotations (tags + image annotations) and Annotations API possibilities, assess if its feasible to 'batch import' these into the Annotations API. The Annotations API will provide a batch import function to do this, and will also support image annotations.

I would like to know for now:
* What kind of information is stored for an annotation in 14-18. 
* How many there are of each type.
* Roughly how much time it would cost to create a script which reads current annotations, transforms them into JSON structured annotations and then sends these per 100 or so to the Annotations API.
* Define the export format that the API-team/ @hugo.manguinhas want the tags in 14-18 to be exported into for easiest one-time batch import via the Annotations API. Based on this we can work on a new annotations JSON structure, a mapping and updates to the Annotations API to facilitate this migration.

Note:
* Tag migration is a must
* Image annotations will be skipped. We won't redevelop that feature unless we find new data or reason to. It's been available in 14-18 for years and we have no more than 67 made.

(3) the grunt task ""js-component-styles"" is executed - the js folder is passed as the required paarameter
(4) the code calling the JS compoenent takes responsibility for loading the styling - this involved using requirejs' ""toUrl"" method to build a link element that gets appended to the dom

Currently our grunt watch task does not include provision for (3), and changes made to scss files under the source/js folder are not picked up automatically.

166181603,1706,"Europeana Radio, iteration 4","For this sprint:
* Back-end & front-end: Extra URL parameter: Filter on items only from one particular institution so that Sounds institutions can embed the player on their website. Eg embedding radio-player.europeana.eu/?institution=Irish Traditional Music Archive would only play tracks from the ITMA.
* SPIKE: When a user adds a genre tag, actually POST the annotation through the Annotations API. In iteration 3 we've done just the front-end and a mock Javascript call. So how do we get this to the Annotations API? To which endpoint should the Javascript POST to? Ideally not the Annotations API directly as we don't want to expose our API keys.

For later:
* Extra URL parameter: Filter only on radio items from playlists with or without annotations. This check should be part of the daily playlist generation.
* Retrieve and display current music genres/tags for the object.

At the moment: when “Link” field is empty in the Image blocks, the credits page will repeat the title. One with a hyperlink leading to the credits page, one as a text (see attachment). It is important for migrated exhibitions where not all the materials are linked – Collections prefers to keep those images inside the exhibitions, even without links, rather than removing them totally. It is urgent because we plan to publish a couple of migrated exhibitions in December.

- Europeana wants to create smaller, one page exhibitions or exhibitions with less content because it's easier than creating a full exhibition
- As a user I want to see something that is easy to digest and will take me back for more
- Europeana wants to have something in the feature boxes which is easy to create and gives the user a reason to come back every day. 

*What do we want?*

Europena has recently started doing smaller curated exhibitions to fill the feature boxes in the Collections. These are still marked ""exhibitions"" or ""what's new"" but are in the Exhibition space and always have a breadcrumb that leads back to ""Exhibitions"". But; they are not always added to the voyer. 

This is a mess. 
 
Currently we only have a voyer for the exhibitions and ""galleries"" (if we choose to go with that name) are not a part of this. We do create them and they can be accessed from the different channel landing pages, but there is no way for a user to know that they are viewing a gallery and not an exhibition. This can be confusing. Also, there is a different set of rules for Galleries and Exhibitions.  

I want to start creating a plan how to tackle this and what needs to be done in order for this to work. As soon as this ticket appears in the sprint I want to start working on User Stories to update this ticket with.

- Look at daily digest at GCI https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/?hl=nl

B. A search result (12-24) of the first items you hit when searching for the entity (by its preferred label)

- Europeana wants to open up the VEs platform to partners because they should be able to create their own exhibitions
- As a user I want to be able to log-in to Alchemy to create my own exhibitions. 

*Problem:* 

We can add / remove new users to Alchemy and assign roles, but the problem is that the confirmation email should be send to the user. Currently when adding a new user, no confirmation email gets send out. 
There must be something wrong. (See attachment for more info) 

*Solution:*

Fix this. 

*Acceptance criteria:*

- selecting the option ""Send email with credentials"" and clicking ""save"" afterwards should send out an email with credentials to the user that was just created. 
- the email should contain: 

_Welcome to our Europeana Virtual Exhibitions Platform
You can now start creating your own Virtual Exhibitions by using the following credentials: 

username: <insert username Admin created in the field ""login"">
Password: <insert password giving by the Admin, created in the field ""password"" / ""Password confirmation"">

Should you have any questions, please contact Maggy Szynkielewska via maggy.szynkielewska@europeana.eu. 

We hope you enjoy your experience!

168375143,1754,Front-end Europeana Radio Iteration 4,"_this ticket is a subticket of #1706 and is based on numerous conversations with the team_

The MVP for Europeana Radio should show a working radio and should live on a static page in (CMS settings) full width. 

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I would like to see a working Europeana Radio displayed on a portal page. 
- I want to see the following things:

*A player block*
which should look roughly like this:

[[image:azUVi8TW0r5QHpacwqjQYw]]

- I want to see the title of the recording (dc:title). The title must be clickable and open up the item page in Europeana in a new tab.
- I want to see the artist (dc:creator)
- I want to see the licence (edm:rights)
- I want to see the image that goes with the record displayed (otherwise the image that is showed in the image) (edm:preview)
- I want to see a playbutton that turns into a pause icon when you hit it 
- I want to see these buttons working (play=play pause=pause)
- I want to see a skip forward button. Clicking it loads the next random track.
- I want to see a working duration-line. 

*A Playlist and Annotation block*
That looks roughly like this: 

[[image:cU7StMTW0r5Ooodmr6CpXy]]

For the playlist: 

- Unlike the above image I want to see 2 tabs with lists of channels in each, one with the genre channels  and one with the institutional channels
- I want to see these tabs working: one should have the list of institution channels and the other one should have genre channels (Classical music, Traditional and Folk music, Popular music). The genre channels should be the first and default tab.
- I want to see a ""play"" icon in front of the channel that is playing. 
- I want to see a music key icon for all the channels that are not playing. 

*The annotation block:* 

- I want to see the annotations block visible when a song is playing
- The annotation block should not show up when the ""jingle"" is playing. (more about the jingle next) 
- There needs to be a box where people can type in their genre. The user must receive autosuggestions of the available genres and must choose one of them. They cannot type in freely.
- This should showcase a predefined list of genres. The user must choose one of them, there can be no ""free tagging"".
- Users need to have a button or some other indication that shows them that they are adding their genres. 
- There should be displayed what users have already added as genres. It would be a nice to have to also block user X from tagging with a genre that has already been added by user Y
- The text should be clear that we are refining the music genre and we want users to help us out
- The list of genres should have consistent formatting (capitals and lowercase) 

*Jingles:* 

- I want to hear a ""jingle"" when you press play (the first time in a session)
- I want to hear a jingle when you switch to one station to another station (like between classical and folk)

*user story:* 
 

- As a user I want a good navigation experience. 
- As a user I want to navigate through the exhibitions. 


*Problem:* 
 

The URL creation in Exhibitions is off. This is something that only recently broke because it used to add the correct URLs automatically. 

_Before:_ 

URL of the intro / start of the exhibitions before:  http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/the-colossus-of-leonardo-da-vinci
URL of the first chapter (so the one after the exhibition intro: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/the-colossus-of-leonardo-da-vinci/the-protagonists
URL of the second chapter: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/the-colossus-of-leonardo-da-vinci/two-concepts-for-the-statue

_Current situation:_ 

URL of the intro / start of the exhibitions now:  http://exhibitions.cfapps.io/portal/en/exhibitions/sausages-and-cigars-for-christmas
URL of the first chapter (so the one after the exhibition intro: http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/hatzenport-during-the-war

You can do an initial set-up and from there the landingpages keep themselves up to date and dynamic. A new way of dealing with browse entry points for the browse landingpage is a first step towards this.

Landingpages of the browse type will have a different browse entry point configuration, which is basically a list of all the facets that are displayed for a thematic collection. A curator can select which facets should be used (from the list of existing facets for the Thematic Collection) and then for each facet selected, the following information must be editable by the editor:

* Number of results
* Thumbnails (boolean, showing thumbnails or not)
* Order

In the design example, the following is set for Fashion:
* Designer (6, true, 1)
* Item type (6, false, 2)
* Technique (6, true, 3)
https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/201651046/comments/74532955

This is an automated process and possibly should be done every 24 hours or so to make sure this is cached.

""http://data.europeana.eu/agent/base/146741"" OR ""Leonardo da Vinci""
(so URI encapsulated by quotes OR the prefLabel encapsulated by quotes)

* The language of the suggested entities should be that of the UI-language. If no match default to English. NOTE: This feature is dependent on an improvement of the Entity API to be able to handle language. See related ticket in the APIs scrum.
* 
* Use the scope parameter in the API call to the suggest method of the Entity API. Add in &scope=europeana to the suggest call to ensure that suggestions are represented in Europeana.
* 
* In the front-end in the search input box, when someone clicks the Entity, it should not be displayed as a regular keyword but as a special 'entity keyword'. Maybe we should wrap it into a box or something with a certain colour.

This is however completely invisible on the Statistics Dashboard beta version - and is something that should be showcased and is of highest priority to be able to do once we've payed off the technical debt enough to make the Statistics Dashboard beta extensible, with new features/pages/feature tweaks.

It needs to be noted that while some of the external platforms have statistics APIs that could perhaps be used to extract Europeana relevant impression on them for display in the Statistics Dashboard it would in the first instance be sufficient to:

- Add a page to the Statistics Dashboard that shows _annual_  impressions on Wikipedia, Facebook, Pinterest, SoundCloud and Twitter. Let's provisionally call it the ""External platforms report"", real name to be decided.
- Since it's an annual report they can be manually created including creating the graphs by uploading CSVs to Datawrapper and embed the graphs into a Statistics Dashboard page
- The report needs editorial text to explain why these impressions are so important, how they differ from views on Collections, etc. Basic HTML - text, paragraphs, links, bold, italic, simple headings.
- A menu option and/or shortcut/call to action on the Statistics Dashboard landing page that leads the visitors to this ""External platforms report""

169275393,1786,Europeana Fashion: SPIKE: Fashion redirects,"Assuming the isShownAt will be removed from all records, how can we still redirect records from europeanafashion.eu to their Europeana.eu equivalent?

A call will take place during this sprint with the technical liaison for the Fashion portal, so discuss this. This ticket is to account for the time of the call + the spike following the call.

*Background*

Requests to URLs like http://www.europeanafashion.eu/record/* need to be redirected to their http://www.europeana.eu/portal/* equivalent.
      
For example: http://www.europeanafashion.eu/record/a/44a88841f6f98aae619a325abf68757e9e4cd0946a0792c041e9861f7f7d7392 would need to be redirected to http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048232/europeana_fashion_55658791_jpg.html

This example record has a web resource image at http://repos.europeanafashion.eu/paulvanriel/55658791.jpg. The SHA256 hash of that image URL is 44a88841f6f98aae619a325abf68757e9e4cd0946a0792c041e9861f7f7d7392, used as the identifier in the www.europeanafashion.eu URL. The SHA256 hash is not reversible, i.e. given _only_ the hash one can not determine the URL it corresponds to.

169275453,1787,Europeana Fashion: SPIKE: Blog & event migration,"Europeana Fashion has a blog feature on their current site: http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/blogoverview.html / http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/
We need to assess whether we can migrate of all these posts into our own end user blog: http://blog.europeana.eu
And tag them with the right tags/categories so they show up on the Fashion Collections.
As both are Wordpress blogs this should be quite straightforward, I'm sure there are plugins which can help with this.

This might be something we also want to discuss in the call we have with the Fashion liaison.
Alternatively, or for the first iterations, we could just link to their current blog, but at some point that site needs to retire.

Question to answer: can we migrate, and if yes, what are the efforts?

--

Secondly, Europeana Fashion has a list of events: http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/eventoverview.html
These are physical events highlighted by the Fashion consortium.
These events should show up in the ""What's happening"" listing below the page.

I would suggest to create a new data type in Europeana Collections called events where we migrate these to, as putting them into our end user blog doesn't seem practical (these are not blog posts), and putting them on Europeana Pro wouldn't either as these are quite some events which are mostly not related to other events on Pro unless we can really separate them.

169301113,1788,Results of Statistics Dashboard Testing,"@jpekel @lbiedinger - In this ticket I will collect my findings. Later we will get through this ticket and decide how to deal with it


1) Top 25 items when selecting show all:
For the full year it shows actually 25 Items
When selecting a month it shows only 24 Items

2) I can not browse Dashboard by Country
(Select from Map returns error: The page you were looking for doesn't exist.)

3) When the Data is still generating you get an message saying:
The page you were looking for doesn't exist.
We should give more appropiate and clear message

4) Sorting of the list of Institutions:
Initially you get a list sorted in the Backend. The Backend seems to take care of diacritics.
There is at the top of the ""All Data Provider Reports"" Page a button that allows you to sort Alphabetically or contra-Alphabetically.
When using this button different rules are applied for where the diacritics fit in the sort-order than when done by the Backend.

5) In the ""Norway Monthly page views of items"" there is a pie graph. The numbers and percentages of the pie parts don't add up to the total.
Found this in Test

6) Down at the page there is the map showing countries. The explanation (after clicking the question mark) says:
These countries generated the most views for this collection this year.
But I don't have any collection selected.
So what is actually shown here?
After some more staring at the page I think that it is about all the collection belonging to the current Data-Provider, Data-Aggregator or Country

7) The ""AVAILABLE FOR RE-USE"" Pie-Chart showing different Re-Use options.
It would be nice to be able to right-click them to open the search for the seleted Re-Use option.

8) In the column with the Pie-Charts there are the sections:
AGGREGATORS SHARING COLLECTIONS
and
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS SHARING
Both point to:
http://europeana.eu/portal/browse/sources
What is the use of this ?

We are looking for the easiest / quickest way to whip something up, but that is also of use for other Collections. Currently VEs doesn't have a ""building block"" to support multiple images and ""galleries"" are also not supported in the CMS.  

*The solution we had in mind:*

- Ideally use Alchemy as the CMS for the Galleries, copy as much as possible from the exhibitions block to reduce effort of first implementation. Reason for Alchemy is that we have taken a principal decision to consolidate on that CMS.
- Make the breadcrumbs say ""galleries"" when a gallery is created and have a separate url in the portal, http://www.europeana.eu/portal/locale/explore/galleries/gallerytitle e.g. http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/haute_couture.html
- We need a Galleries foyer page with the same design as the exhibitions foyer where each gallery is represented by a tile. The tile design should differ from the exhibition tile design so that they are distinguishable from each other.
- The Gallery foyer and individual galleries to be available under the Explore menu option
- The editor must be able to add a title for the gallery. The CMS should ensure it is unique by appending a number if necessary 
- The editor must be able to choose one or more themes, from a controlled list of theme values (to begin with: Art, Music, Fashion, Photography), that the gallery matches
- The editor must be able to add a max 280 characters long description per gallery
- The editor must be able to add at least 6 and up to 24 images to a gallery. The max number should be in a config file for easy modification.
- We want the design to support credits per gallery image: Title, Creator, Creation date, Data provider, Rights value/icons, Link to item in Collections. Note that these are exactly the same as the credits on a Collections hero image and Exhibition items. Metadata can be added by the editor, or as a nice to have, be fetched via the Europeana API by the editor supplying the item link.
- The following actions must be available per image in the gallery slideshow: Social share (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr), Download, Zoom in, Full screen, Paginate left and right

_Nice to haves:_
- The CMS acts as a Europeana API client and the editor just supplies an item URL per image and the CMS pulls in the metadata and the image via it.
- All galleries are automagically added to the Europeana sitemap for search engines
- The gallery images should have oper graph and Twitter card markup for better display on social media, primarily Facebook and Twoitter
- The editor should have the ability to add an image caption freetext of up to 280 characters.
- For images from a data provider for which we have a logo the logo is automatically included in the display
- The CMS acts as a Europeana Annotations client and automatically adds a relation between the items in the gallery and the gallery itself. This lays the foundation to have a visual reference from the Collections item display to a Gallery.


*Notes/suggestion:*
- For a first implementation why not keep things simple and just use the image viewer component as we do for images in Collections and use Photoswipe, http://photoswipe.com/ for the front-end display. It has basically all the display features that the acceptance criteria requires and we can reuse an existing front-end component and keep down the number of moving parts.


*Acceptance criteria:* 

I want to know how much time it will cost to implement this and what would be the quickest but best way to go about this. 
I will need 

- suggestions on how to do it 
- overview of work on each way to do it

170172883,1803,14-18: Create visual item-display for 14-18 items,"Based on references/documents in #1684.

This ticket is for me, Carlos & Lutz to work together and create a visual item display of what a 14-18 item would look like in the current Europeana.eu item display. We should use one or two 'full' records as an example, and based on that assess what we need to change/improve in order to provide a rich user experience for 14-18 records. What would be good to do is to also reference the exact field names in the visual, so we know exactly which data is coming from where.

I will be coordinating/cross referencing fields, Lutz can provide input on item display logic & Carlos can mock it up.

As for the complete overview of fields/mapping as provided in #1684, we should also make an overview of which fields will be missing (if any) from the item display.
This ticket and the next can work as a suggestion for a new/improved way of mapping.

* start a new contribution
* save a draft of my contribution
* finish my contribution and submit it
* review my current/past contributions

A spike was conducted last year to investigate possible strategies for the UGC process in the thematic collection of 14-18, for context & reference:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SRSJzhdQxf1i-rzVAKJImVz1LWOeZG1W2BmLUJ-hja4/edit#heading=h.za3uggkwxomm

It has been decided to go for ""Strategy 2: partial deprecation"", meaning that in the first iteration of a 1914-1918 thematic collection with UGC support we will *present* the above functionality to contributors on the Collections site, but continue to have the existing 1914-1918 application doing the work, i.e. processing and storing these form submissions.

(NB: It is acceptable to still use 14-18 for admin/management of for instance stories by an administrator.)

This ticket is to:
* Create an overview of things we should find out to implement this strategy as well as dependencies (MyEuropeana will be one).
* Create a technical design/overview of how we will implement this.
* Create an overview of tasks which need to happen to implement this.

170565103,1814,Instructions to Collections CMS editors to compress/edit hero images prior to use,"*Issue*
On Europeana Collections images intended for use on the landing pages are often uploaded at great resolution (even when used as promo tiles) and minimal or no compression. This makes the page weight of the page very large and thus loading times correspondingly slow which has a negative effect on both UX (esp. on mobile devices) and SEO (load speed is a ranking signal). 

Practical experience shows that in many cases and for most humans compression and even colour reduction is hardly noticeable. See e.g. https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization#optimizing_raster_images

An example is http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art where for example the Da Vinci promo tile is a full 1419x1419 pixels/841kb (can be reduced to c. 400x400, compressed and even perhaps reduced to a 256 colour depth). The hero image weighs in at 575kb with likely no or very low compression of the JPG. A compression to 10-30% would reduce the hero iomage weight to about 30-50kb which is significant gain and with little discernable quality loss.

Compressing these two images would reduce the page weight with c. 1MB which is a lot (esp. over slower connections).

*Proposed solution*
Update the CMS editors manual with information in regards to image compression and processing pre-upload and ensure all CMS editors are made aware of the issue.

170948753,1825,Limit What's happening to 30 items ,"NOTE: SEE COMMENT BELOW ON NO NEED TO ALLOW SWIPING BEYOND 12 ITEMS.

*User story:* 

As I user I expect to see blogs, tumblr and events in the ""What's happening""-feed on the thematic collections. 

*Problem: *
 
For the new ""What's happening"" we are using an aggregated feed of feeds, or at least that is the intent. Technically for now if you go beyond 12 items on the new landingpage you will only get Tumblr images because this merging of feeds has not yet happened:
http://test.npc.eanadev.org/portal/en/collections/fashion

Furthermore: the idea is that the section will also contain blogsposts (either coming from the end-user blog, e.g. with the category 'fashion') and events (coming from Bolt, the CMS for Europeana Pro. which are f.e. marked with the category or tag ""fashion"".) 

*Solution:* 

We should think about how we solve this technically and implement it as well as part of this ticket and implement the solution. 

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I want a technical solution for this and I want to see it implemented. 
- I want to see the What's happening is sourced from an aggregated feed of feeds which for Fashion means Tumblr & blogs & Events, in chronological order descending.
- I want to see events, blogs and tumblr updates appear in the What's Happening section 


*Note:* 

- _Please keep in mind that these feed either comes from the end-user blog or the pro-blog in the longer term._ 
- _What we would like to include here is the feed from the Events in Bolt too (see http://pro.europeana.eu/events)_

171671683,1851,SPIKE: How to handle blogs and events in Collections,"*Background:* 

The Europeana Fashion portal is closing in March and Europeana is migrating all of their content to a Thematic Collection. 
Now that we have tackled the ""Themes"" by Spiking the Galleries last sprint; this sprint we would like to investigate how where and how we can deal with the events (for reference check: http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/eventoverview.html) and (from a technical point of view) their Blog (see: http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/blogoverview.html). 
It was already decided by the Collections team that the Fashion blogs can be hosted on the Europeana End User Blog. (Category would be ""fashion"") 

*Problem:* 

Europeana Collections currently doesn't support Events and the blog is not fully integrated in the (technical space and design of) Collections. The End-user blog currently also has a separate CMS system (wordpress). What we would really like investigated for this spike is how to best technically implement and integrate these events and the Blog with Europeana Collections. 

Also; the current blogs and events need to be migrated to Collections and up until this point it seems to be that this will be a manual process. For this Spike we would like to investigate how to tackle these problems from a data, design and technical point of view and get an estimation of the time it will take to implement this. 

*Editoral data that is required:*


*Blog:* Title, author. date of publication and update, category (with the possibility to add multiple), tags (one or more), blog text, abiility to include one or more image per blog post,  abiility to include embeds (like youtube / video / soundcloud), the possibility to add links in the body text and other basic formatting like paragraphs/bold/italics and so on. Comments are a nice to have and if we implement them they should be Disqus based.

The blog display must include social media buttons (facebook, twitter, pinterest, etc. - same as in Collections elsewhere) for sharing. It's a nice to have to be able to include a picture and the name of the  blog post author. Another nice to have is an estimated time to read, using e.g. https://github.com/michael-lynch/reading-time

For reference and inspiration, see.eg. http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/01/access-easily-sounds-from-europeana-sounds-collections/ and http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/blogdetail.html?post=maria-callas-from-diva-to-icon) 

*Events:* Title/name of event, body text, images in body, date of publication, start time and end time of the event, location/map for the event. Events should be possible to classify into Categories, like Exhibition, Conference, Workshop, etc.

For reference and inspiration: http://pro.europeana.eu/event/digital-past-conference-2017 and http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/eventdetail.html?event=exhibition-across-art-and-fashion 

*Notes on the Design:*
See ticket [[url:https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-npc/tickets/1259-end-user-blog-migration/details|#1259]] for reference

The most important thing here is that the design will fit the Europeana Collections design without reinventing the wheel entirely as we already have good designs for blog and event in Pro/COPE. 

*Suggestions and nice-to-knows:*

- The Fashion blog currently runs on Wordpress as does the End User blog. There might be a plug-in to support the migration but the Wordpress version of our End-User blog is terrible outdated so we can't tell what will happen if we update this and install a plug in. 
- We would like to have as few CMS's running as possible, so it would be very nice if we could decide on one CMS to rule them all or at least take a step towards that by eliminating Wordpress.
- We could use COPE and PRO designs as a base for the visual designs for both Blogs and Events. 

*Acceptance criteria:* 

We want to know how much time it will cost to implement this and what would be the best way to go about this while being able to keep the launch date of Fashion which is first week of March.

At the end of this SPIKE we need to have the following:

- One or more suggested solutions for which CMS to use, with one recommendation from a technical point of view
- Estimation of implementation per solution
- Pro's and Con's per solution, incl. ease of migration of legacy blog posts and events
- Designs in Invision for Blog list, Blog post/page, Events list, Event page. 

So that we in Sprint 40 can begin implementation based on proper technical and UI designs and have a production ready solution in place by the ned of Sprint 41.

171762553,1863,SPIKE: Make an individual Gallery embeddable,"STUB ticket, not Ready for injection in a Sprint log.

IDEA:
Make Galleries embeddable via JS-widget (worst case an IFRAME but not sure that would work) in Exhibitions, see mail from Douglas below
To be embeddable a Gallery must have only CC or PD licensed images? Then we could open up for all users to embed them.Which would make them available also off-Europeana and reach even more users. Should be coupled with the ability to get stats on their use. One way to do that could be to power the feature via Embed.ly as we do in 14-18 and which gives us off-site impressions in the Embed.ly stats console.

Mail from Douglas that also clarifies the internal need:

<pre><code>If - and tell me if I'm being greedy - the gallery feature could also be deployed within the exhibitions platform, that would be great.
 
The current full-width image focused presentation works really well for fine art etc. but is not well suited to objects such as jewellery and ceramics. It would be good to have the option of presenting a (dynamically tiled based on image aspect, a la Europeana Collections?) grid selection of objects, within the page width, from which the user could choose to enlarge and, if desired, visit item pages. One current workaround is embedding a Pinterest board but that's less than optimal, for obvious reasons.
 
An outcome of the current platform's constraints can be that small exhibitions end up having a disproportionately large amount of navigation. For example, the WWI Sausages exhibition is less than 900 words long but has six chapter tiles and quite a lot of scrolling for a relatively small exhibition, IMO. Having the gallery feature, and other options to compactly present images, might alleviate this.
 
Working on the new Art Nouveau exhibition has surfaced these thoughts, in case you're wondering! I do understand the platform is relatively new and I definitely appreciate all of the hard work that's gone into its creation and development thus far.

* The editor must be able to add/edit a a max 280 characters long description for the gallery foyer
* The editor must be able to add/edit a title for the gallery. The CMS should ensure it is unique by appending a number if necessary 
* The editor must be able to classify a gallery as being relevant to 1 and up to 3 topics, from a controlled list of theme values. NOTE: These are NOT exactly the same as the themes of the thematic collections.
* The editor must be able to add/edit a max 280 characters long description per gallery.
* The editor must be able to add/edit/remove at least 6 and up to 24 images to a gallery by adding in a Europeana object URL with the application then fetching the relevant metadata and the edm:isshownby image. The min/max number should be in a config file for easy modification.
* The following metadata is pulled in via the Search API record call: Title, Creator, Creation date, Data provider, Rights value/icons, Link to item in Collections and the image in edm:isshownby. Note that these are exactly the same as the credits on a Collections hero image and Exhibition items. 
* The editor must be able to depublish a gallery (but should be advised not to delete them)
* A CMS Admin must be able to edit a list of controlled theme values that the gallery editor can match a gallery with. To begin with: Art, Music, Fashion, Photography, First World War, Literature, Food and Drink, Natural history, History, Architecture, History of Travel, History of Science, Maps and Cartography, Performing Arts, Military history, Migration, Archaeology. To the editor these should be listed alphabetically. The purpose of these is to align them with current, future and potential thematic collections.

*NICE TO HAVES (NOT PART OF THIS TICKET):*

The purpose is to make it possible to in the item display of Europeana Collections include links from items to the gallery(ies) they are included in - this helps build intra-item links for improved SEO and browsing UX.
* The CMS automatically adds to each gallery: Date of publication and which CMS editor who published it.

171803103,1867,Display Galleries in Europeana Collections,"*Business motivation:*
The Galleries will rely on an aesthetically pleasing display that encourages the user to explore and also share the galleries and their images. The aim is that galleries will be interesting to many of our users and thus help increase the total number of item views and file downloads and also increase inbound links and referral traffic. They should also positively contribute to engagement (measureable via metrics like Avg time on site, Pages per visit, and Returning visitors). 

*Acceptance criteria:*

** Gallery foyer, https://invis.io/CS146E9BR#/213622476_Collections_Galleries_Page_It01_Bpxl Note (1) the ability for users to filter galleries on theme and to socially share the foyer. Note (2) also the addition of Galleries under the Explore menu which also adds a level 2 menu showing the most recently published galleries. Note (3) the hover on the i-icon. Note (4) also the pagination at the bottom of the screen. Finally, note (5) to by default show 24 galleries per page. URL to be http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries
** Gallery page,https://invis.io/CS146E9BR#/213958005_Collections_Gallery_Page_It01_Bpxl Note the ability for user to socially share the gallery page. URLs to be like http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/haute_couture.html
* Image viewer/slideshow, https://invis.io/CS146E9BR#/214308983_Collections_Gallery_PhotoSwipe_B_It01_Bpxl Note the actions for Full screen, Social sharing and Downloading. As this is based on Photoswipe paginating should be possible via arrow keys left and right.
* It must be possible to in Google Analytics track views of items in the viewer/slideshow. This may require custom events to be added (note: I don't think Photoswipe images have URLs for GA to catch without custom events!?). 
* It must be possible to in Google Analytics track downloads of image files from the viewer/slideshow via its Download actions. In GA this Download event must be distinct from downloads from the Collections item page.
* It must be possible to in Google Analytics track social sharing of images from viewer/slideshow via its Social sharing action

*NICE TO HAVES:*
* Add Twitter card and Open Graph markup to the Gallery foyer
* Add Twitter card and Open Graph markup to the Gallery page. For Twitter this should be a Gallery card, https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/gallery
* Add Twitter card and Open Graph markup to the individual images in the viewer/slideshow. For Twitter this should be a Summary card with Large Image, https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary-large-image


*IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE:*
These are listed for quick discussion so that the team is made aware of potential future development directions.

* Instead of a pagination element a click to incrementally Load more (another 24 galleries). 
* A Gallery gets a ""calculated (on display) aggregate rights value"" that marks if the gallery is for Free reuse (all included images must be PD/CC0/CC-BY/CC-BY-SA), Limited re-use (all included images must be licensed for reuse but at least one of them is ND or NC) or No-reuse (if 1 of the images is All rights reserved the entire gallery gets this mark). Apart from providing the user with explicit rights info on the Gallery as a whole this value can later be used to control whether a Gallery is (o)Embeddable by users/external clients.
* Galleries are made searchable via keywords, a search box is exposed on the Gallery page
* Galleries become an API-endpoint, allowing developers (with a key) to list (possibly also search) galleries and retrieve individual galleris. The individual gallery call response must JSON-LD formatted and aligned with the EDM Collections profile.
* Allow authenticated My Europeana users to create and publish Galleries
* Extend the concept of galleries to allow editors to create e.g. playlists of sound recordings or videos.

172081493,1872,EPIC: Make item page API calls after page load,"The goal of this epic is to move as many API calls as possible made at present during initial generation of an item page so that they are instead triggered by the front-end after page load.

The need for this is that the performance of the item page is very poor, typically taking 2.5s-4s just for the initial HTML content response from the server. The primary cause of this poor performance is the number of calls to APIs made by the portal application to gather all the data required to generate all the features for the item page up-front. As we add features to the item page dependent on APIs, the number of external HTTP requests increases, response time increases, usability decreases, which very likely frustrates and disengages members of our user base.

To begin with: Art, Music, Fashion, Photography, First World War, Literature, Food and Drink, Natural history, History, Architecture, History of Travel, History of Science, Maps and Cartography, Performing Arts, Military history, Migration, Archaeology. To the editor these should be listed alphabetically. The purpose of these is to align them with current, future and potential thematic collections. *NOTE:* So there are actually many more of these topics than there are avalaiable thematic collections. That is intentional.
* #1906 Add a check and error message to the editor for items that don't have an image link in edm:isshownby
* #1907 Add caching of HTML on gallery foyer and individual gallery pages, for performance
* #1908 Make it possible to filter the gallery foyer according to the gallery themes/topics listed above.
* #1909 The CMS automatically adds to each gallery: Date of publication. Intended to allow sorting of galleries in the UI by publication date.
* #1906 The CMS enforce number of images from 6 to 24
* #1911 Unpublished galleries must not be viewable unless logged in as an admin

*CMS/Backend nice to haves:*
To make into its own user story.

* The Collections CMS acts as a Client of the Annotations API and annotates each object that is part of the Gallery as being part of the gallery. The purpose is to make it possible to in the item display of Europeana Collections include links from items to the gallery(ies) they are included in - this helps build intra-item links for improved SEO and browsing UX.

172586263,1892,SPIKE: In-Collections display of blog posts from Pro via RSS,"*Background:*
When discussing how to best manage blogging overall in Europeana one solution proposed is to:
* Solely use the Europeana Pro blog, http://pro.europeana.eu/blogposts and its Bolt CMS
* Use a controlled vocablary of Categories and Tags to filter and consumer the Pro blog RSS and display selected blog posts in Europeana Collections and on Thematic Collection landing pages. For the latter there'd be a matching tag for every theme. There would need to be either a Category or specific tag per blog post to mark a Pro blog for inclusion in Collections - this because not all end-user oriented blog posts match a theme. That tag could be as simple as ""EuropeanaCollections"".

The advantage to this proposed solution is that Europeana would not need to maintain a separate Wordpress instance or develop blogging functionality in the Collections CMS or Alchemy CMS. We could those consolidate technically and save time on development.

*Purpose of this SPIKE*
Make an *estimate of feasibility and estimate of effort* to consume the Pro blog RSS, http://pro.europeana.eu/blogposts/rss/feed.xml and use it to:
1. Populate the Blog menu
2. Populate the Collections landing page News
3. Populate the Thematic Collections landing page (both default and the new alternate layout that Fashion will use)
4. Display, in Collections, a paginated blog list page showing all blog posts. This would need to account for the possibility that blog posts may be unpublished.
5. Display, in Collections, an individual blog post in full

4 and 5 is conceptually comparable to how Europeana 1914-1918 is currently pulling in blogposts from the ""hidden"" blogger instance we use for 14+18 editorial content, and would replace blog.europeana.eu as Europeana's end-user blog.

The display style of in-Collections blog post and blog list should as much as possible use the templates already in PatternLab and used in Pro.

*Notes:*
* It is not currently possible to filter Pro blog posts by tag or combination of categories and tags. The Pro developers have been asked to work on it with high priority.

Technical solution for info: The aim is that blog posts will be pulled in via RSS from Pro and displayed (in full) in Collections.

* In general: use a blog template from the Styleguide/PatternLab for Pro and adapt for Collections
* We need in Europeana Collactions a page with all the end user blogs the *Blog List Page*. It should be similar/can be very similar to http://styleguide.europeana.eu/?p=templates-ListPage-blog in style and in content - if anything:simpler! It will need pagination and should of course list the blog posts from most recent to oldest.
* Each *individual blog post page* must have: Title, publication date, blog post text, one or more images or embedded media players, categories and tags, an author.

* Nice to have: Comments. We can live without in the first implementation, perhaps beyond as comments add little value.

173178913,1915,"As a human visiting an item, I can see what gallery it's included in, so that I can explore similar content","*Technical headline:* Create links between item pages (CHOs) and Galleries

*Background:*
The large majority of users arriving to Collections arrrive to an item page, not the Collections home page or a thematic collections landing page. The item page is also the type of page most viewed. So: how can we make the item page be a landing page in and of itself? One that provides and signals paths for the user to continue to explore Collections?

Two things we do already: Similar items and Canned searches. 

This story will add the basis for a third such path: Showing the user the gallery(ies) and item is included in and allowing the user to navigate to the gallery.

*Suggestion:*
The Collections CMS acts as a Client of the Annotations API and annotates each object that is part of the Gallery as being part of the gallery. The purpose is to make it possible to exploit this in the item display of Europeana Collections. It would allow us to dsiplay links from items to the gallery(ies) they are included in. 

This helps build intra-item links for improved SEO and providing pathways for navigation in Collections and thus improve UX for exploratory discovery style users and serendipituos discovery.

*Context*
The wider context is described in epic #1916

*Notes:*
* This particular story is about implementing the annotations only. Not how to display them in the UI. I'll add a story for that later.
* For how to format the annotations this is a task for @hugo.manguinhas and the APIs Scrum team.

173180343,1916,"EPIC: Navigating across and between CHOs, blog posts, galleries, exhibitions and themes","*PROBLEM*
As we know from user research we can do a lot better in making browse a part of the user journey, thus extending it, deepening it and tying together different components (items, thematic collections, blog posts, exhibition, item sets like galleries and playlists) together into a whole that the user can navigate between. 

We also know that we have an issue in SEO in that our items relate only to other items via the Similar items feature. Establishing more internal linkage will make it easier for the Google crawler to crawl all our items (compared to just going through our sitemap) and influence our relevancy ranking via improved internal linkage.

*IDEA FOR A SOLUTION*
* Make the Collections CMS for blog posts, galleries and exhibitions use the Collections object (or entity) as an atomic unit
* Make it possible to via the Annotations API annotate objects and entities in Collections with the blog posts or exhibitions in which they are featured
* Revisit the mass-tagging and search macro features ideas for channels/thematic collections, https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-creative/tickets/45 and in greate detail https://docs.google.com/document/d/15nqqs7M9V25iku9NsiEfXl-vJpWh31LmyaYVA__cvho/edit

Doing this brings together information siloed in blog posts and exhibitions with the objects/entities in Collections, the Collections object/entities becomes an atom that is created once and published in many places. 

On a more abstract/conceptual level, this helps us connect objects with their context/interpretation, and context/interpretation with objects.

In Europeana Collections we would then use these links in the display to *signal to the end-user the availability of these relations and navigational paths*. Like in this now old lo-fi wireframe:
https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/1083571/78693285/preview 

Scroll down and note the visualised link-relation The Milkmaid here has to the Art Collections, one particular Exhibition and one particular Blog post. Which the user can of course click to navigate to.

_Collections CMS as API read client_
When an editor includes a Collections item in a blog post, exhibition or gallery the CMS supports them in that by pulling the item in via the Europeana API incl. core metadata (title, creator, rights, data provider, links - attribution snippet).

_Collections CMS as API write client_
In the background, with no manual effort from the editor, the CMS annotates the items used in the curated objects with the URLs of those items/CHOs. That way each item ""knows"" where it has been reused or referenced in Europeana sites and this can be exploited in the UI of Collections as envisioned in the early designs (see wireframe above).

This could be seen as a specific type of semantic/relation tag, an ""intra-Europeana sites bi-directional link"".

*Notes*
The two examples above use Collections objects as the case. It might as well be an entity e.g. connecting our entity for Vermeer with the blog posts and exhibitions in which he is featured/included.

In terms of UI display we could consider using og/twitter and/or oEmbed as ways to dynamically call in the necesary information to create ""cards"" in the object and entity display pages of Collections to the collections, exhibitions and blog posts they are included in.

Once we get to doing the User created sets items featured in those should also ""know"" that they are, cp. Rijksstudio e.g. https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-5 where the 3 most recent Rijksstudio collections in which the Night Watch are included in are featured on the Night Watch page.

*Potential connections and navigational paths*
* Item (EDM CHO) level and all ""curated"" levels:
* Items to Thematic collections, which would require a ""big batch annotation""
* Items to the Europeana Radio playlist
* Items to Exhibitions, see #1554 and https://europeanadev.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/245
* Items to Galleries, see #1915
* Items to Blog posts
* Items to Entities (here the link is already explicit in the item metadata via the contextual classes)
* Entities to Exhibitions (From Agent Mucha to Exhibition on Art Noveau in which he heavily features)
* Entities to Galleries (From Agent Mucha to Gallery of Much posters), see #1939
* Entities to Blog posts (From Agent Mucha to Blog post on our Art Nouveau Colouring Book)
* Entities to Entities (From Agent Mucha to Concepts Art Nouveau and Poster)


Of the above establishing relations (modelled and implemented as annotations) between items and blog posts/galleries/exhibitions would be the most prioritised IMO.

As part of the Metis preview service, we are utilizing a specific collections instance of the portal that communicates with a specific separate backend (metis-preview-portal.cfapps.io)

Some of our collaborating organizations requested the ability to embed the preview of this portal in their own applications (NTUA-MINT). This will allow the users of those application to preview how data would look like in Collections before actually submitting it to Europeana for harvesting. Currently this is impossible as all iframes of the Collections application are blocked. 

As a Metis developer I would like to be able to specify that this instance of the portal can be embedded in an iframe.

Allow certain IPs to iframe Collections?

To improve the discoverability of galleries, esp. in external search engines, editors should be able to add keywords to the galleries. These are intended to be more fine grained classification that the gallery topics e.g ""paintings"" or ""sculpture"" or ""alchemy"".

Another motivation is to increase internal linkage, navigation and the potential for cross-language search and display those keywords can be in the form of entities drawn from the Europeana Entity Collection. This can later be exploited in the form of canned searches or by connecting entity display pages with galleries relevant to the entity as decided by the presence of these tags.

*Acceptance criteria:*
* An editor must be able to add up to 6 tags per gallery
* When an editor adds a keyword they get autosuggestions from the Europeana Entity Collections that they can choose from. If they choose an autosuggestion the CMS pulls in the URI and the (multilingual) labels. 
* In display the multilingual labels use the same business logic as for other vocabulary based labels (try to match UI language and if there's no match show English)
* If they don't choose an autosuggestion the keyword becomes a ""freetext"" tag with no underlying URI. It must be in English only.

173833803,1943,Rijksmuseum identifiers provided as enrichment links do not resolve,"Internal Rijksmuseum identifiers are being exploited to provide entity enrichments for their records. For example, see http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_1896_A_19118.html?q=gillray, and find at the bottom of the page under Entities > Persons and Organisations the identifier for James Gillray, RM0001.PEOPLE.34868.

Clicking on this leads to an attempt to resolve the link by appending the identifier onto the Europeana namespace. Understandably this does not resolve.

This is unfortunate. Beyond the fact of the 404, experience has shown that Rijksmuseum identifiers are extremely helpful ways of browsing through the collection (that is to say, a search on 'who:RM0001.PEOPLE.34868' is a useful one).

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

- I want to see TwitterCard and Open Graph mark up added to the galleries. 
- For Twitter this should be a Summary card with Large Image, https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary-large-image
- For Twitter: title of the gallery, large image (first image of the gallery) and description. 
- For Facebook: title of the gallery, large image (first image of the gallery) and description. 
- For images inside the gallery; stick to the portal pattern ie the same markup as for an individal item.
- For Pinterest use the same solution as for pinning item pages, https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/widgets/save/
- Descriptions: For the foyer the description to be marked up is the 280 character description an editor can add to the foyer.  For items that don't have a description add, just like in item display markup, a default text ""Find out more on Europeana"".
- Copy for the description of the gallery and the share: ""Culture curated for you! Discover Europeana Galleries!

As many other sites we rely heavily on organic search traffic. Google has a 90% plus market share in Europe so when we say organic search that basically means Google.

The last year we have seen the number of indexed Europeana item pages drop radically from its peak at 25 million pages to now stabilising around 6 million. This has resulted in a noticeable drop in organic search traffic. 

This SUPEREPIC represents our work to reverse this trend.

*Stats:*
The numbers vary a bit, but currently about 2.7% or the records in our sitemap are indexed. We should try to improve this.

175119773,1993,Make Galleries embeddable on external websites,"*Background:* 

One of the main goals of the Galleries is that curated content drives organic traffic to the site from two ends; the fans have a reason to visit the site regularly and it helps improve SEO. They pass authority from one page to another (search optimization), they guide visitors to item pages (usability) and enhance the user experience and prompt visitors by acting as calls-to-action (support browse on site and partner clickthrough). To further optimise the SEO, it would be helpful to allow others to embed the galleries (in an iFrame) to their own websites to support their content. 

*Scope of this ticket:* 

As we create great galleries, we want to let others incorporate our content into their work. By making it easy for others to embed the galleries on their site, we're  increasing the potential for more inbound links to our own website – clearly an SEO win.

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I would like to see the possibility to generate an embed code in the galleries (design)

175359903,2013,Add character max for Gallery descriptions to the CMS UI,"*User story:* 

As a CMS user I would like everything to be as clear as possible so I can work effective and make minimal mistakes. 

*Problem:* 

Currently the CMS doesn't tell you that the gallery description can hold up to 280 characters. It does this only when you have exceeded the amount of characters before you save, which I think is a bit annoying if you could've known that to begin with. We do communicate this to the users but it would be a _nice to have_ if the cms told you this before you make a mistake. 

*Solution:* 
Similar to what is under 'title' now; I would like to see that there is a 280 character max for the description. 

*Copy:*
_""Optional. Describe your gallery - maximum 280 characters.""_

*Acceptance criteria:* 
- I would like to see ""Optional. Describe your gallery - maximum 280 characters."" in the CMS UI underneath the description field.

175363043,2014,Resilience to Annotations API being offline,"In order for the Annotations API key data store change to be deployed to its production environment, it will likely need to be taken offline momentarily.

This will result in the stock Cloud Foundry error page which returns plain text like: ""404 Not Found: Requested route ('notfound.cfapps.io') does not exist.""

This can be simulated by setting in the app env EUROPEANA_ANNOTATIONS_API_URL to a non-existent CF app URL, e.g. http://notfound.cfapps.io/

If the Annotations API endpoint starts returning this, both the portal and radio will fail where they make requests to it. The error handling they already have in place is still not capable of handling this type of response.

They therefore need to be adapted to handle this scenario, before the [[url:https://app.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-apis/tickets/524|Annotations API change]] makes it to production.

175536763,2020,Spike: Uploading images to static pages ,"*Background:* 
Europeana has a lot of static pages in the portal, but currently we can only add images to them by adding browse entry points, or doing so in the HTML (which also requires the image to be stored somewhere or link from somewhere that is not Europeana). Since we want to improve the CMS and make the life of the editors easier, it is worth it to at least investigate how much time it will take to add the possibility to upload an image to a static page in an easier way. 

*Assignment:* 
At the end of this sprint, I would like to see a proposal on how to go about adding images to the Europeana Portal Static Pages, which will allow the editors to do so in an easier way then it is now. 

*Acceptance criteria:* 
- I want to know if it can be done. 
- If so I would like to know what the best solution(s) will be. 
- I would like to know what the pro's and cons are (for each of the solutions if applicable).  
- I would like to have a time estimation for the solutions.

175562623,2021,Blog post read time,"We want to display estimated read time for blog posts on both the listing page and individual post pages.

There exist JS libraries for this such as https://github.com/michael-lynch/reading-time, the likes of which is used by Pro for displaying same.

The reading time JS libraries work by examining a block of text, e.g. a blog post body, for which they need that block of text. That is fine on the individual blog post page, but on the listing page the full text is not present for the JS library to examine.

The way that Pro circumvents this on the listing page is by performing AJAX requests to retrieve each full blog post, which is undesireable to say the least, and not an approach we will take on the Collections site.

There is also the limitation of these libraries that they are not i18n-aware, i.e. will only output those summaries in English.

We will therefore inclined to do this on the back-end which does already have access to the full blog post bodies when generating the listing page.

There is a Ruby library for this here: https://github.com/garethrees/readingtime, but it is also not i18n-aware, so we should fork it to our Github organisation, make it translatable there, then send a PR back upstream to the gem maintainer.",3,,,2017-03-09T13:13:33.000Z,1,109.0,true,7270973,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2017-06-16T08:44:57.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""Editorial""}",2,,,

176058693,2024,Redirect Fashion portal search URLs,"When the Europeana Fashion site is retired, Collections needs to handle URLs for the Fashion explore/browse/search, i.e. any URL one gets by browsing that site from http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html

This is complicated by the fact that they implement search and filtering in the URL fragment (the bit after ""#""), which is only ever seen by the browser, never by the server. My thinking on how to handle this gracefully is that we need a blanket redirect from http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html#fragment to http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/fashion?q=&from=europeanafashion.eu#fragment, with the front-end then inspecting the URL fragment for these Europeana Fashion search and filter terms, translating them to the equivalent URL query parameters in Collections and then redirecting to that URL.


*Redirection logic:*

* Only trigger this redirection logic on the Fashion collection landing/search page when the URL query parameter `from=europeanafashion.eu` is present
* If there exists a URL query parameter named `inpSearch`, rename it to `q`, injecting "" OR "" between terms
* Parse the URL fragment into field:value pairs, e.g. ""Designers%3DBernhard%20Willhelm%26searchTerm%3Dsocks"" is equivalent to ""Designers:Bernhard Willhelm"" + ""searchTerm:socks""
* Add query parameters for each of the field:value pairs from the URL fragment, per the following mapping
* `searchTerm` in fragment becomes query param `q`, injecting "" OR "" between terms and overwriting any that already exists
* `dataProviders` in fragment becomes query param `f[DATA_PROVIDER][]`
* `dcCreator` in fragment becomes query param `f[CREATOR][]` with "" (Designer)"" appended to the value
* `datesNormalized` in fragment has value (e.g. ""1000-1499"") split by '-' character, with first part becoming query param `range[YEAR][begin]` and second part becoming query param `range[YEAR][end]`
* `color` in fragment becomes query param `f[colour][]` but with the URI in the fragment rewritten to the English label in the param
* `objectType` in fragment becomes query param `f[proxy_dc_type.en][]` but with the URI in the fragment rewritten to the English label in the param, and ""Object Type: "" prepended
* `techsAndMaterials` in fragment becomes query param `f[proxy_dc_format.en][]` (for techniques) or `f[proxy_dcterms_medium][]` (for materials) but with the URI in the fragment rewritten to the English label in the param, and ""Technique: "" or ""Material: "" prepended, respectively
* `from=europeanafashion.eu` should then be removed from the URL query

*Obstacles:*
# `color`, `objectType` and `techsAndMaterials` URL fragments are problematic because in the Fashion portal it uses their thesaurus URI but in Collections we use the English label, so the front-end would need some way of translating from the former to the latter. I think that we will need to obtain a mapping of all Fashion thesaurus URIs to their English labels for those fields and have it stored as a JSON data file in the styleguide. *See attached [[file:bWnLgEcL0r54oLdmr6CpXy|fashion-thesaurus-map.en.json]] and [[file:dcom2YcL8r54koacwqjQXA|fashion-thesaurus-map-numeric.en.json]]*",2,2017-04-18T10:17:12.000Z,,2017-03-16T09:58:30.000Z,1,-91.0,true,11131743,"bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,djQ1OaATWr4Of6acwqjQYw,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,bt2bnGU54r4AGmacwqjQYw,aybbJ63Vur4BxmacwqjQYw,bmoXZQr3Kr5OojacwqjQXA",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2017-04-18T10:17:12.000Z,0.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""Environment & Architecture""}",2,,,

For the Galleries foyer the difference is marked in Google PageSpeed evaluation:
* For production 0/100 on both mobile and desktop (with thumbnail APIs)
* For acceptance 42 mobile, 55 desktop (directly from S3)
* 
If we identify that a thumbnail API is preferable and/or necessary vs direct access of thumbnails on S3 or other object store, then the thumbnail API needs to be made significantly more performant. It may be decided that we should deploy it as a dedicated micro-service, one which can be tuned for serving binary media and scaled independent of the Search/Record API.

* On creation make a check that the shownbys return a proper JPG or PNG MIME-type. To avoid broken images.
* Make them embeddable offsite incl. a special internal embed in-Exhibition function (the latter is Douglas idea as an alternative to them frequently embedding Pinterest galleries). With automatic checking of copyright that enables/disables the embed option. oEmbed compliant.
* Make them searchable in Collections (will be needed once we have them in the hundreds, which will be soon...). A first simple implementation could be to do it in the browser/same way as for the sources page!?

* Pin one gallery per thematic collection to the top of the list, to accommodate communication / marketing / topical themes priorities at a given time
* Add support for other media than images (e.g. music to demonstrate what a musical instrument sounds like)
* A way to preview the gallery - every gallery curator so far has asked ""can I see a preview?""
* Include select technical metadata in the viewer (file type and pixel dimensions), to help a user decide whether an image is of sufficient technical quality for their intended use and thus dowload-worthy
* Add an end-screen in the viewer that shows 3-6 related galleries to the one that the user has just finished - to never dead-end a users navigational path without encouraging them to explore further.

177652763,2084,BUG: Filtering option doesn't trigger resetting the page number ,"*Problem:*

On both the events and the Gallery filtering option, filtering via the ""filter by"" on Galleries and the ""view"" on Events doesn't trigger an automatic page reload. 
For an end-user this means that the illusion is created that there ""are no galleries related to that topic"" or ""there are no past events"", when in fact they are there, they're just not on that page. 

*An illustration of the problem:*

_For Events:_

[[image:bjY3LWgUqr56q5dmr6QqzO|blob]]

There are no ""future events"" included in the page above. 
But there are indeed ""future events"" if you look among all the events. 

When you switch to ""future events"" in the ""view"" box however... 

[[image:cynZJegUqr56TtacwqjQXA|blob]]

It will show you... nothing. 
This tells me that it does filter. But it filters within the information on the page only!

_Something quite similar happens to Galleries:_ 

[[image:aY0cyGgUur55Zcdmr6QqzO|blob]]

Notice how on the final page for the Galleries, there are (f.e.) no Fashion galleries, only art. 
However, I do know that there are fashion related Galleries in the foyer. 
Triggering that search however, will give you: 

[[image:bIPyU6gUur54dcdmr6QqzO|blob]]

And will also make it look as if you are back at page 1. 
This tells me that the page search is triggered for in the page, and for the user it might look as if the page is reset back to one. Not showing anything, which is not true. 

_*Replication of the problem for Galleries:*_ 

-  Go to the gallery foyer
- Pick a page that has content with only one topic like http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries?page=3
- Filter on a topic that is not represented on the page (f.e. fashion)
- Notice the problems above. 


*_*Replication of the problem for Events: *_* 
- When you are on a page with past events, quite far in the past, like: http://test-npc.eanadev.org/portal/en/events?page=3&per_page=96&sort=past
- Switch to future events, the page number gets no reset: will give you the screenshot above. 
- Notice that the URL with parameters looks like this: http://test-npc.eanadev.org/portal/en/events?page=3&per_page=96&sort=future

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I would like to see the following behaviour: 
 - triggering the filter would filter in all content, not just the content on the page.

After talking to @lbiedinger we established that there was no ""quick way"" to solve this because adding the ""blog"" label to the Blog would also make it appear on the ""events"" feed. You could argue that since the events are not displayed in the what's happening, this shouldn't be a problem, but we would like to do things neatly around here!

*Solution:* 

Can we add the ""blog"" label to display on the blogs in the ""what's happening feed"" without affecting it any other form of content in there? 

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- The blog 'label' should say ""Blog"" not ""news""
- I would like to see the blog tag appear on the blog content in the ""what's happening feed"" consistent with the design here:

while the dropdown in exhibitions displays almost all of them (or seems to try so): 

[[image:as_FcuibSr55KZdmr6CpXy|blob]]

*Proposed solution:* 

I would like the dropdown in exhibitions to be mirrored to the portal one, so the exhibitions dropdown in exhibitions needs to display the first six. 

*Acceptance criteria*

- I want to see the same behaviour for the Exhibitions dropdown as the portal dropdown for exhibitions.

We are turning 1914-1918 into a thematic collection and the deadline for this is around mid-end June. 
In order to estimate and prioritise work, we need to not only cover all the technical work, but also the design work and front end implementation of this work together. 

*Your challenge:* 

I would like to see possible solutions for the user registration, login and contribution dashboard. 

*Game rules:* 

- All suggestions need to be implementable within 1 month of development time
- Solutions need to be kept as simple as possible given the fact that we only have one front-end developer available and this superperson does have other stuff on his plate too. 
- Bear in mind that we keep the functionality that current 14-18 has in tact. 
- _All functions remain in the standalone 1914-18 site_.

178675883,2114,Pinterest won't share IIIF images ,"*Userstory:* 

As a user I want to share images on my Pinterest board so I the world can see how happy I am with Europeana. 

*Problem:* 

Currently, when a record has a IIIF viewer, pressing the Pinterest Icon on the portal will produce a 'image broken' icon. If you use the Pinterest plugin, it will allow you to pin directly from the image, _but_ since the image is made up from tiles, it allows you to share that tile, not the entire image. 

_Example of sharing a 'tile' via the plugin:_

_Example of what happens when you share via the social sharing button:_

Can we make it so that sharing the entire image is possible?

-  I would like to share the entire image on my pinterest board.

We are turning Europeana 1914-1918 into a Thematic Collection. In order to integrate the UGC features into Europeana Collections we came up with the solution of iFraming the features to prevents (heavy) development on the 1914-1918 application and Collections. 

*User EPIC:* 
As a user I want to be able to upload my UGC to Europeana Collections. 

*Implementation:* 

* Remove layout elements, e.g. header, footer and navigation, from 1914-1918 templates, leaving just the core content.
* Create a page on the Collections site embedding the 1914-1918 UGC functions in an iframe, e.g.: 
 /portal/en/collections/firstworldwar/contribute

This iframe will need to handle the following functionality from 14-18:

1.  europeana1914-1918.eu/en/users/register (non-logged in users registration)
2. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/users/sign-in (non-logged in users sign in)
3. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/users/password/new (non-logged in users password reset)
4. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor  (non-signed in users links to register/login and help pages OR overview of logged in user's stories)
5. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/users/account (overview of logged in user's account details)
6. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contacts/[NUMERIC USER ID]/edit?redirect=%2Fen%2Fusers%2Faccount (edit account details page for logged in user)
7. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/new (signed in user's new contribution form)
8. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/[NUMERIC CONTRIBUTION ID]/edit (signed in user's edit contribution form)
9. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/[NUMERIC CONTRIBUTION ID]/delete (signed in user's delete contribution confirmation form)
10. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/[NUMERIC CONTRIBUTION ID]/attachments/new (signed in user's new item form - also signed in user' view of existing items)
11. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/[NUMERIC CONTRIBUTION ID]/attachments/flickr (signed in user's flickr item creation - requires user to be logged into flickr too?)
12. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/[NUMERIC CONTRIBUTION ID]/attachments/[NUMERIC ATTACHMENT ID]/edit
13. europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/[NUMERIC CONTRIBUTION ID]/attachments/[NUMERIC ATTACHMENT ID]/delete (signed in user's attachment deletion confirmation form)

Additionally the 14-18 app allows logged in users to edit their login credentials, however this functionality is broken. when requested it will result in ""The resource you requested was not found.""
# europeana1914-1918.eu/en/users/edit?redirect=%2Fen%2Fusers%2Faccount

179314513,2127,Federated Search: The Ruby Gem,"*Background:* 

See ticket #2125 for the full background on this. The purpose of this ticket is to work on a Ruby gem providing a normalised interface to query the various federated search providers, with a Rails engine for ready integration into Rails apps, implementing only features relevant beyond the Europeana Collections use case. 

*User story:* 
As a user I would like a normalised interface to query the various federated search providers so I they will get displayed properly in on the results pages. 

*List of requirements:* 

- Responses should conform to JSON API
- Should be capable of querying multiple APIs in parallel
- Should gracefully handle errors from APIs, both application-level (e.g. record not found, invalid query) and infrastructure-level (e.g. internal server error, bad gateway)
- Would need to handle credentials for those APIs that require them
- Should implement support for Europeana's Search/Record API, for use by others
- Could be inspired by the pattern of the Ruby oEmbed library re registering providers
- Should be readily extensible by others, like our extension of the Ruby oEmbed library for providers it does not support out of the box
- Should have a Rails engine to provide the controller, routes, and JSON views to Rails applications
- In a first (pre-1.0.0) version, to support our use case it would only need to implement a DSL to run simple search queries and return:
    -Total record count
    -Configurable number of records to return, but no pagination
    -Title and thumbnail URL of records returned
    -Links to full search results and individual records on provider’s website

*_PLEASE NOTE:_* In future, it is anticipated that it may be extended to support pagination and faceting of searches, and individual record retrieval
NB: careful consideration would need to be given as to whether we have the resources to commit to maintaining a much more feature rich and hence complex open-source library to an acceptable standard

*Acceptance criteria:* 
-  a simplified and normalised Ruby interface to multiple third-party APIs to facilitate record searching, and later retrieval, without the need for a developer or their application to (necessarily) have intimate knowledge of the workings of each API.
- Ruby Gem should have it's own github
- Should be added to rubygems.org",2,2017-06-06T07:23:54.000Z,,2017-05-01T13:06:50.000Z,1,-29.8125,true,11320203,"djQ1OaATWr4Of6acwqjQYw,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,bmoXZQr3Kr5OojacwqjQXA,d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2017-06-06T07:23:54.000Z,0.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8,djQ1OaATWr4Of6acwqjQYw,"{""Theme""=>""Search""}",2,,ash.marriott,https://s3.amazonaws.com/assembla-avatars/2ab8d8d1/d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8:1494504262
179314993,2128,Federated Search: The Collections Application,"*Background:* 

Please see ticket #2125 and #2127 for more background. 
The scope of this ticket is to create The Collections application for the Federated Search. The application would need to bundle the Ruby gem and mount the Rails engine to get access to the federated search functionality. It would furthermore need to implement any Collections-specific features.

*User Story:* 


*Requirements:* 

- New db model representing a federated search with columns for:
    -Collection ID (foreign key)
    -Federated search provider (from those provided by the Ruby gem)
    -Search query (for collection-specific searches in the context of the provider)
- Rails Admin CMS configured to allow configuration of federated searches nested on the collection add/edit forms
- Front end to request from the Rails app result counts and thumbnails for each enabled federated search provider via AJAX after initial page load and populate the display in the middle of the search results
- Front end to be entirely responsible for construction of the tabbed view for federated search results, as these are AJAX and hence JS dependent

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I want to see an application that bundles the Ruby gem and mount the Rails engine to get access to the federated search functionality.
- I want see an application that implements any Collections-specific features.
- As an admin, I can choose to enable or disable the federated search on a per-collection basis
- As an admin, I can choose which federated search providers to include (because some may have no value for a specific collection)
- As an admin I should be able to specify the specific base-query via the CMS on a per-provider basis, by collection.

179316243,2131,Federated Search: Design implementation ,"*Background:* 

For more background, check EPIC #2125. 
In order to implement the federated search to the search-result pages in the 1914-1918 Collection, we need to have a design of what it's going to look like. Previous sprint the design got approved to be this: https://invis.io/SPBEAH487#/229906102_Collections_Federated_Tabbed_Module . The scope of this ticket is to implement and bring the design to life on the portal. 

*User story:* 
As a user I want to see non-Europeana sources included in the search results so I can browse those as part of my knowledge quest of WW1 information. 

*Your mission:* 
Implement the design that is here: https://invis.io/SPBEAH487#/229906102_Collections_Federated_Tabbed_Module and bring it to life on the portal!

*Design Specs:* 
STUB @cr.marcelino can you write these after refinement? 

_On Desktop:_ 



_On Mobile:_ 

https://invis.io/4BBF6NKGM#/230416938_Collections_FederatedSearch_Mobile_Bp_Small_2
- each tab will be just a image showing the 1st result of the query of that source
- the label is similar to the 'View all' on desktop, taking you to the search result page of the source (as when you click the image)
- in this case when there's no image in the 1st result we use the logo of the source
- again expanding will be the opt-in for the module

*Acceptance criteria:* 
- I want to see the *exact* design brought to life on the portal. 
- I'd like a localization key on the call-to-action bar so that this can be translatable
- I would like a google analytics event so we can track usage of this button.

179317173,2132,SPIKE: Facets on 1914-1918 Thematic Collections ,"*Background:* 

Currently we have chosen to not include the facets in the 14-18 Thematic collections because of the complexity of it. 
However: turning 14-18 into a Thematic Collection, also implies that the users of the previous 14-18 portal are now moved over to the Thematic Collection. 
These users can't destinguish anymore between UGC and the Institutional Content, but, should they? Ah: UX problems arrise!

*Your mission for this SPIKE:* 
Investigate how we can go about Facets in the 1914-1918 Thematic Collection. How can we tackle the problem from a UX point of view. 

*Acceptance Criteria:* 
- I want to know if we should do this and what the best UX options are
- Create an overview of things we should find out to implement this. 
- Create a technical design/overview of how we will implement this.
- Create an overview of tasks which need to happen to implement this.

The Statistics Dashboard is not working well and we do not have the resources to improve it without compromising the redevelopment of 14-18 and then Newspapers.

*TODO:*
Before May 10we should shut it down and redirect all its URLs to a page that says:

""The automated dashboards have been temporarily shut down as Europeana is currently working on changes to the data structure. For statistics on Europeana usage, please visit our statistics area on [[url:http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-statistics/|Europeana Pro]].""

*Value in fixing:* If we're going to be using the browse landing page more frequently, and we're doing additional work to it, then we want to make sure it receives the best social exposure possible.

The browse landing page layout - used in e.g. Fashion - has a main promo tile in its top half. Sometimes called Tile 0. However the image of that tile is not the one linked to in og:image. Rather it's another image, the one set to decorate the background the search box is displayed on in the search results page (see e.g. http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion?f%5BCREATOR%5D%5B%5D=Emilio+Pucci+(Designer)&f%5BTHUMBNAIL%5D%5B%5D=true&q=&view=grid - it is now some sort of lacey cloth). This is potentially confusing to users sharing the landing pages as that image does not even appear on the landing page. Instead the image in promo tile 0 should be mapped to og:image and be the one shared.

*Acceptance criteria:* 
 - The image for promo tile 0 = og:image.

179728073,2144,Improve page-load time by optimising the similar items AJAX search,"Implemented within Collections is a JSON endpoint for retrieval of other items similar to a given record, e.g. http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/92093/BibliographicResource_1000086156490/similar.json

This results in two API queries: one to the Record API to retrieve the metadata for that record; another to the Search API to search for similar items after a suitable query has been constructed from the record metadata. This is necessary given the absence of any similar items method on the API itself, but makes the AJAX implementation of similar items slow to complete.

*Proposed solution:*
Given that during initial page generation for an item page the record metadata has already been retrieved, it should be possible to instead generate the similar items query at that time, and supply to the front-end a URL for a JSON search with those query parameters already in place, negating the need to re-run the query to the Record API.

*Acceptance criteria:*
Similar items AJAX should calls go to /portal/en/search.json, not /portal/en/record/123/abc/similar.json in order to decrease the delay.

As a war enthusiast, I can browse other sources, to get a global picture of the war

*Problem:* 

Currently the federated search that we have implemented works given the data model it needs, but to give it the model on page load would slow down the loading of the page, 

*Proposed solution:* 

We would like the the javascript to query the back-end for the model.
So we need to ""ajaxify"" it. 

*Proposed workflow:* 

- a collapsed section with no federated search results in it yet
- the user opts in by expanding the collapsed section
- at this point an AJAX query is made to /portal/search/federated.json?q=fish which returns structured results per the template model
- these are rendered in the expanded section

*Acceptance criteria:*
- I want to see search results requested after initial page load by AJAX, and only if the user expands that section.

180255793,2177,ISSUE: Can't get CRF-based facets to work in thematic collections query filters together with regular keywords,"Example:
I want a filter that reduces results to only maps and images of certain sizes (medium and larger). 

Which is the equivalent of this http://mediadiscovery.europeana.eu/?action=search&query=what%3Amaps&provider=&data_provider=&mime_type=&image_size%5B%5D=medium&image_size%5B%5D=large&image_size%5B%5D=extra_large&image_colour=&image_aspectratio=&full_text=&sound_hq=&sound_duration=&video_hd=&video_duration=&colour= which in API-terms is http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?query=what%3Amaps&rows=25&start=1&qf=IMAGE_SIZE%3Amedium&qf=IMAGE_SIZE%3Alarge&qf=IMAGE_SIZE%3Aextra_large&profile=facets&wskey=api2demo

So I try to set the query filter to:
qf=what:maps AND (IMAGE_SIZE:medium OR IMAGE_SIZE:large OR IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large) which results in an invalid search

I try  qf=(IMAGE_SIZE:medium OR IMAGE_SIZE:large OR IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large) AND what:maps and also get invalid query

In short, I find myself unable to set a query filter that combines keywords with CRF-based facets. The Media Discovery tool indicates it should be possible in terms of API.

So, am I doing something wrong? Or is there an issue and some limitation in the current setup that we can remove?

180680793,2195,SPIKE: Define what type of Category pages Europeana could and should offer to improve user browse and SEO,"Category pages are key in sites with a large number of pages, typically eCommerce sites (where categories typically represents categories of products for sale: ""Cars"", ""Pickup Trucks"", ""Lorries"", ""Motorcycles"" etc.). Such Category pages are valuable because if you have many products per category then they compete with each other for link juice and ranking: one page called ""Our Cars"" with some unique copy often ranks better than the 100 individual pages of cars.

So what can we in Europeana consider to be Categories?  The Entity pages are intended to, in SEO terms, serve as Category pages but beyond those?

Quick list of potential categories and category pages:
* Institutions (data providers): Basically this would be to give each data provider an entity page and ensure it has unique copy and links to items provided by that country. We also know our users often search for insitution names and should ensure their names appear in the autosuggestions. 
* Languages (of content, not metadata). Pages that list e.g. Texts in English, French, etc. And the same for audio and video. 
* Colours. Pages describing a colour and then listing images dominated by that colour.
* Copyright values that allow for re-use. A unique page per each or at least one for Free reuse and one for Limited reuse.
* What's new. But would need to be restructured and combined with using Institutions as sub-categories and showing a sneak peek per institution.

Implementation notes - should the spike recommend to do so: 
* All Category pages must have English locale only OR have unique copy per language. Copy should be unique or at worst taken from Wikipedia.
* All Category page titles must be human readable (so a colour page should be e.g. Burgundy, not a colour HTML-code). 
* The layout could be very similar to that of Entity pages with a representative image per category, short copy and a sneak peek of items for the category with a link to see them all. 
* The Category pages must have its own separate sitemap for search engines.",3,,,2017-05-19T12:47:10.000Z,1,-667.0,true,7270973,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2017-05-19T13:19:06.000Z,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,ahQtmgU58r4zF-acwqjQXA,"{""Theme""=>""SEO""}",2,,,

180756893,2197,EPIC: As a researcher I want to be able to batch download newspapers data for visualisation and analysis,"*Problem*
The current batch downloads (custom JSON format) contain old and now outdated TEL media and HTML links and are also not IIIF compliant. This makes them unreliable and more difficult to view than they could and should be.

*Suggested solution:*
Take advantage of the IIIF protocol and transform the JSON files to be IIIF compliant and when doing so update the metadata and media and HTML links to being stable Europeana ones. 

The feasibility of this has already been proof of concepted by Nuno.  

Proof of concept example:
http://universalviewer.io/uv.html?manifest=http://test-solr-mongo.eanadev.org/europeana-research-newspapers-dump/sample-2017-04-26/1878-01-01.manifest.jsonld#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-3137%2C-193%2C8428%2C3851

Benefits of doing this early in our Newspapers Collections development cycle include:
* This is a quick win for Europeana and our researcher users and enables us to deliver something valuable early in what is otherwise going to be an extended development cycle
* It provides us a target format for IIIF compliant JSON that we then have to develop APIs support for to be able to dynamically output based on user queries. This will be very useful for the developers implementing that API.

*Acceptance criteria:*
* Create a Europeana Newspapers IIIF Collections which in turn contains one Collections per Newspaper title and then the issues as IIIF Manifests within. We'd have to coin Europeana URIs for the Collections and Manifests. 
* Update the metadata in the manifests with the metadata we have available esp. the provider name and the rights value. For the richest possible given the available metadata
* Include in each manifest a link to the OCR:ed text for that issue.

This ticket is to determine how we handle the future translations of Europeana 1914-1918. 
Since there is an integration with Collections coming up, we just need to decide on how to go about this. 

The workflow used to be translate wiki based, now it's via locale app, but the question might be if the translations that are in LocaleApp right now (including the 18 localisations) are up to date. 
This ticket is to SPIKE the workflow from a technical point of view.

180898433,2205,Display updated Translations and Copy in Collections via the iFrame,"*Userstory:* 

As a user I would like to see relevant information about 14-18 displayed in the Collections. 

*Possible Problem:* 

Currently the iFrame is displaying everything in 1914-1918, but the info in the copy for 1914-1918 is not up to date. So the copy needs to be updated. (see ticket ... in editorial sprint) 
The usual workflow was for all the text to be localised in Translate Wiki but since we have terminated their services; we now need to make sure that the right copy is displayed in the iFrame via a source other than that and make sure that the updated version of the copy ends up in 1914-1918. (And therefore is displayed in the iFrame.)

*Acceptance criteria:* 

- I want a connection between the copy on 1914-1918 and a source. 
- I want to know the source because the Collections team needs to update the copy. 
- I want the updated copy to display in the iFrame 

*Things that might be helpful to know:* 
- I think we still used LocaleApp as sort of a CMS system for the creating the source xml for translate wiki. Ergo: all the text should be present in Locale.
- I also recall that at one point there was a connection between LocaleApp and the 1914-1918 website. I don't know if there is any documentation about this, but it seems to me that it might be the case that if there is, the connection is easy to restore; meaning that LocaleApp is probably the best candidate for 'the source' of the localisation. 
- In terms of the Portal working with LocaleApp already, I would prefer the source to be LocaleApp.

Please could we follow the implementation steps below to do this:
---
*Add Optimize to your website*

*Step 1: Update your Google Analytics Tracking code
*
Do the following on every page where you want to use Optimize:
Move your Analytics snippet as high as possible in the <HEAD> of the page.
Copy this line of code (the Optimize plugin):
ga('require', 'GTM-K7MPPLG');
Paste into your existing Analytics snippet as shown below:
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
  ga('create', 'UA-12776629-1', 'auto');
  ga('require', 'GTM-K7MPPLG');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>

*Step 2: Minimize page flickering*
This snippet ensures that users only see your variant content, minimizing page flicker. Learn more
Copy the code below
<style>.async-hide { opacity: 0 !important} </style>
<script>(function(a,s,y,n,c,h,i,d,e){s.className+=' '+y;h.start=1*new Date;
h.end=i=function(){s.className=s.className.replace(RegExp(' ?'+y),'')};
(a[n]=a[n]||[]).hide=h;setTimeout(function(){i();h.end=null},c);h.timeout=c;
})(window,document.documentElement,'async-hide','dataLayer',4000,
{'GTM-K7MPPLG':true});</script>

Paste it just before your updated Analytics tracking code anywhere you want to use Optimize.

If you do not have Analytics on your site, or for other ways to deploy Optimize, including serving it with Google Tag Manager, refer to the Optimize help center.

 - The tag should sit on all pages of the collections site.

182185323,2238,TECHNICAL DESIGN: System architecture and configuration for the Newspapers Services,"*Requirements depend on the outcome of the Wednesday workshops*

We need to outline a system architecture for the newspapers services.

Some key design challenges:
- Should the newspapers database be separate and distinct from the Mongo database of other records? Right now we have three sources for newspapers: TEL Solr, Europeana Mongo and Neo4J (harvested from TEL and represented as EDM), Europeana Cloud (where Nuno is now working to store IIIF compliant Newspapers metadata). TEL must per force be deprecated.

182608223,2251,Upgrade ellipsis on search results (grid view),"*Background*

In css the rule ""text-overflow: ellipsis"" can only be applied to single lines of text.  For multi-line text (such as in the search-result grid-item summaries) alternative approaches are required. 

Originally the search-result grid-item summaries used javascript to help style them by applying ellipsis as necessary.  This javascript was considered to be resource-intensive when 96 results were present (the text flickered slightly as the script inititialised) and complex to maintain.  It was replaced with the (current) CSS approach last year - a technique with a good performance but which is visually less appealing (the ellipsis appear in a margin rather than in line with the text)

The javascript ellipsis was revamped and improved as part of the work on #2131.  It no longer relies on any specific markup and it manipulates text node values rather than full nodes, and is more efficient as a result.  It can be seen [[url:http://styleguide.europeana.eu/patterns/templates-Search-Search-results-list/templates-Search-Search-results-list.html?view=grid|here]] under the ""non-Eurpopeana sources"" results.

Any solution must be applicable outside of this dataset, i.e. hard-coding exclusions for the 1914-1918 URIs alone is not to be considered acceptable.

Sometimes these items are also in galleries and this can cause the gallery to fail completely without warning.

*Proposed strategy:*
 - Create a new ""galleries"" channel in Slack
 - Store edm:isShownBy on GalleryImage
 - Run a scheduled job at 08:00 and 15:00 (UTC+1) to retrieve from the API the record for each gallery image; use the Search API with rich profile to get data for all images in a gallery at once
 - If the record no longer exists on the API, alert Slack ""Record for image x in gallery y [link] has been deleted"", include a URL to the gallery if possible
 - If edm:isShownBy has changed, alert Slack ""edm:isShownBy for image x in gallery y [link] has changed""
 - The job also attempts to retrieve the image over HTTP
 - If image retrieval fails, alert Slack ""Image x in gallery y can not be retrieved""
 - No automatic removal of images or other alteration of galleries occurs
 - Editors required to manually check and update/unpublish galleries

183402003,2268,SPIKE: Investigate the feasibility and best UX of making IIIF imagery downloadable,"*Background:*
Europeana is investing in supporting the development and adoption of the IIIF-framework. We have a number of datasets already that are viewable in Collections in our IIIF-viewer.

However, Europeana is also about reuse and we currently don't have a way of supporting users to download the IIIF images they're viewing. We want to develop support for this - not the least to support our own Newspapers users - and also officially designate downloadable IIIF-resources as potentially qualifying for Tier 3+ according to the Europeana Publishing Framework.

Use cases for IIIF downloading are documented here by Henning: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUzlPXRTVxPYrK4GzF4j47d-fgneKBti9ibFMcSuBKU/edit#

*_The purpose of this spike is to investigate the feasibility, best UX and effort of making IIIF imagery downloadable by users of Europeana Collections._*

*Notes:*

_Viewer support_
While we're currently using Leaflet IIIF we are considering adopting the Universal Viewer. The Universal Viewer has built-in affordances for configuring Download and Print options based on IIIF Manifests.

See for example http%3A%2F%2Ftest-solr-mongo.eanadev.org%2Feuropeana-research-newspapers-dump%2Fsample-2017-05-25%2FNational_Library_of_Luxembourg%2FJournal_historique_et_litt%2525C3%2525A9raire%2F1773-08-01.manifest.jsonld#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-1403%2C-115%2C4060%2C2275 which is a proof of concept of displaying Europeana Newspapers IIIF manifests in UV.

_IIIF Manifests_
For IIIF Manifests the publisher of a manifest can include links specifically for the purpose of downloading or printing the object. See http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#rendering This should probably be the first place our client looks for a resource to ""connect"" to our Download button.

When a ""render"" field is not present our client can fall back to ""connect"" the links to images in the canvas @id:s . 

Note that for manifests that contain multiple canvases (""multi-page documents"") this would mean we can only offer download of pages 1 by 1. But that's better than nothing! Note also that canvas images can be very hi-res: a Gallica canvas for a portrait aspect image is often around 15 000 x 6 000 pixels. Pixel dimensions and image format are always included and format may be included.

Gallica IIIF-manifest example: http://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/btv1b55002481n/manifest.json

_IIIF Image request response_

In cases where we don't have a IIIF manifest but instead a IIIF Image request response URI the info.json call includes the max pixel dimensions and a identifier on which a call can be made to get a JPG file. See http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#image-request-uri-syntax

* I've got an interest in an artist such as Leonardo Da Vinci, I want to know more about him, and the work he has created.
* *What do we lack to do this at the moment?* - A user friendly way of being certain that what you're looking at is created or related to that correct person. What if there's more than one Leonardo? What if the keyword matches are incorrect? _This design aims to solve this issue by presenting the relevant items in the correct context, and reassures the user they're browsing under the correct user_.

Scenarios/potentials for use:
 - From an item page, where you have a creator as 'Leonardo Da Vinci', the user could click that link to see who this page has been created by.
 - From a search page, where you're searching all items by a specific entity, you could have a content card representing that person with a link back to the item page.
 - From the entities autosuggest, you could have some sort of direct link back to 'Leonardo Da Vinci' when a user types in a search that seems relevant.

Please note:
 - All Entity API client development needs to work against the test Entity API URL *via Apache* for the time being, i.e. http://test-npc.eanadev.org/api

Use of it would follow the same pattern as the DSL for the other API methods, documented in the README, e.g.
<pre><code>Europeana::API.entity.fetch(type: 'agent', namespace: 'base', identifier: '98053', wskey: 'YOUR_API_KEY')</code></pre>

* entity controller has a show method which queries the Entity API for the requested entity using the API key from the environment variable
* controller responds to requests for an entity in JSON or JSON-LD (URL path extensions .json and .jsonld) with the unmodified API output

Property http://www.europeana.eu is receiving data from redundant hostnames. Some of the redundant hostnames are:
europeana.eu
www.europeana.eu
Redundant hostnames are counted as separate rows in reports, so hits that are going to the same page on your site from different hostnames will be split into multiple rows. With data split across multiple rows, traffic to specific pages will appear lower than it actually is.

To avoid this problem, consider setting up a 301 redirect from one of your redundant hostnames to the other, or create a search-and-replace filter that strips ""www."" from hostnames.

Google Tag Assistant Recordings can help you verify that your redirect is setup correctly, or that your filter is working as intended.

Let's get autosuggest out of the door.

Scope
 - Home and collection pages only

Why?
 - Well it's great. For many reasons.
 - We have no Google-esque way of telling users that they've misspelled. This won't solve that, but it will guide their spelling at the point they make the search helping them get to their result faster.
 - It will differentiate when there are identically named people, or places, or similarly named. 
 - Clicking on an option that says 'Leonardo Da Vinci' is a concrete way of knowing that what they have clicked is exactly what they're searching for. It removes the ambiguity.

API
 - At the moment, we can use acceptance Entity autosuggest API as it is the most up to date. Hugo will give us updates on any issues occurring on the API.",2,,,2017-07-20T10:04:26.000Z,1,125.0,false,7270973,"",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2017-08-22T09:09:04.000Z,0.0,0.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,,d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""""}",3,,,

Let's implement the Autosuggest as per Carlos' design.

*Mobile not in scope*

Acceptance criteria:
*General*
 - The autosuggest box should only appear when there are results to display. No predicted results, no box.
~ - We should show a maximum of 5 results per group.~
 - When a list of results is rendered, pressing down highlights the top result in the list. Pressing up and down continues to highlight the relevant results.
 - Pressing enter on a highlighted result executes a search for that entity.
-  Pressing a key on the keyboard that does not result in characters being added to or removed from the search box should *not* result in an AJAX request
*Closing the box*
 - Pressing escape will close the autosuggest box and return the cursor/selected state back to the search box.
 - Clicking outside of the autosuggest box should close the autosuggest box.
 - MouseOver and MouseOut should do nothing in terms of hiding or showing the box.
 - Should be able to tab into the box
*Re-querying*
 - Subsequently adding or removing characters in the search box will re-trigger the auto-suggest query.

184934123,2308,SPIKE: An MVP approach to collecting UGC,"*This spike includes a scheduled meeting for Weds 26 July*

We are going to need to build a User Generated Content solution for handling content for migration.

In my head, this could be something as simple as a form that submits content to a Google Spreadsheet. The Google Spreadsheet gets reviewed by editors, the media is stored appropriately and then we transform that content into something that is ingestible. If a user requests it be removed, we do it manually.

It needs to fulfil the following criteria:
 - The ability to submit text data
 - The ability to upload images and videos
 - Facility for an editor to review the incoming content
 - A solution for the content to be ingested
 - The ability to remove content
 - Secured against bot entries (recaptcha)

Considerations:
 - This needs to be an absolute MVP approach. We're not trying to wow the submitting content here, we're trying to please the people viewing the content.
 - Manual intervention is an option if it is difficult to automate.
 - We should look at using off the shelf data collection tools such as SurveyMonkey, Zoho forms and Google forms.
 - Users do not need to be able to edit their content after submission.
 - Removal of content does not to be done by the end user, they can simply request it.",2,2017-08-07T13:35:44.000Z,,2017-07-21T09:55:00.000Z,1,-12.0,true,11593573,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,0,Done,0,2017-08-07T13:35:44.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""""}",2,,,

Contributor can go to a collection day, creates one record that includes a picture of an object, and a story that explains that object, could create another record that is a sound recording of their trials and tribulations with a description alongside. No direct link between them, but they could be related by the Author name.


This should be completed ideally by the end of November, but won't be launched until March so at latest we have until the end of January with leeway.

* Need to consider both vague and accurate dates of events/objects (Roughly the 1950s, or September the 3rd 1995)
* Moderation is not a requirement
* Editing of content would be ideal in order to improve the quality we output
* We need to allow reporting of migration content that is offensive or otherwise.
* Media *must* be stored in the European Union
* Should consider the future of 1914-1918

187050383,2385,EPIC: Prepare for SSL enforcement,"The revised outcome of #2265 was that SSL enforcement has been readied for the Collections site, but not applied.

In preparation for SSL enforcement, we need to:
* #2392: add https://www.europeana.eu/ to Google Search Console properties
* #2393: separate robots.txt for http/https, as recommended by Google: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6033049#https-faqs
* #2394: separate sitemaps for http/https, as recommended by Google: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6033049#https-faqs
* #2395: consider whether to SSL galleries by loading images through the media proxy (see #2265)
* #2396: edm:preview URLs are http://europeanastatic.eu/api/image; on search results we rewrite this to https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json, but not on facet links on browse landing pages, and need to do so; also find out if/when edm:preview from API will have the thumbnail API URLs
* #2397: images from Pro JSON API are over http:// preventing secure blog post and event pages

*TODO:* create sub-tasks for the above

After this, SSL should be enforced, by undoing https://github.com/europeana/portal-apache-web/commit/c497af975990c378f4aca9e32745b222a43de23e",3,,,2017-08-23T10:09:36.000Z,1,-12.0,false,11791963,"bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2017-09-20T08:32:39.000Z,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""Environment & Architecture""}",3,,,

187065413,2387,Migration of Assembla to Jira,"This will be a full migration from the [[url:https://www.assembla.com|Assembla]] ticketing tool to the [[url:https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira|Jira]] issue tracking tool and is based on the findings in the earlier [[url:https://app.assembla.com/spaces/europeana-npc/tickets/new_cardwall#ticket:2352|spike]].

Since there are no migration tools available on the Jira Marketplace for Assembla, it will be necessary to write this in house especially adapted to our requirements. This ticket will be divided into the following three phases:

* Europeana Collections
* Europeana APIs
* Europeana Infrasctructure
* Europeana Data Partners
* Europeana Design and UX

First step will be to migrate the Collections Space first as pilot, maybe initially in parallel with Assembla to catch any missed discrepancies, with later decision base on results to migrate the other spaces.

The Assembla data consists of the following elements:

<pre><code>Users
 - Groups
 - Permissions
 - Roles
Tickets
 - Associations
 - Comments
 - Components
 - Importance
 - Statuses
 - Tags
 - Types
 - Estimates
Milestones
Wiki pages
Workflow
</code></pre>

Wiki pages fall out of scope until an alternative for documentation has been found (Google Docs, Confluence or whatever).

Jira issues look like this:

<pre><code>Types
- Bug
- Epic
- Story
- Task
- Sub-task
Statuses
- Open
- In progress
- Reopened
- Resolved
- Closed
- To do
- Done
Resolutions
- Done
- Won't do
- Duplicate
- Cannot reproduce
Priorities
- Highest
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Lowest
</code></pre>

From now own the term *export* refers to the action of exporting data from Assembla, and the term *import* refers to the action of importing that data into Jira. The stored export format will be readable CSV for future reference as well as backup.

The following tasks need to be done:

* Export all data to CSV (done)
* Import users, permissions, groups and roles (done)
* Create new Jira project (done)
* Create new labels, tags, sprints, priorities, states and issue types for mapping (4h)
* Import tickets (12h)
* Import comments (4h)
* Import/upload attachments (4h)
* Setup issue associations: related, parent/child, etc (6h)
* Milestones and sprints (this can be done manually)
* Links and markdown conversion in comments, description (this can be done manually)
* References in Git commits and PR comments (4h)

A ticket `has many` comments and `has many` attachments, and each comment and attachment `belongs to` a ticket.

A ticket `space_id` is mapped to a corresponding `project` in Jira.

A `ticket` is converted into a Jira `issue`, where those tickets with a non-zero `is_story` value are tagged with `issue type` = `story`.

Milestones are covered by referring to the ticket `milestone_id`.

A ticket `component_id` needs to be mapped to the relevant Jira `component`.

Each created Jira ticket will reference the original Assembla ticket number and will have a label `Assembla`. That way there'll be a permanent link referring back to the original Assembla content, e.g. no context lost, as long as the Assembla website is accessible.

All of the scripts have been written in Ruby, and they can all be re-used as is.

188876053,2431,Investigate: some records on ingestion portals have no thumbnails or previews,"Reported by Pablo.

Scenario:
* CRF has been run by ingestion on a specific dataset
* CRF has completed and shows no errors re generation of thumbnails (for web resource from records in question)
* Searches for this dataset on an ingestion portal show some records to have thumbnail previews, some to have generic, some to have neither
* Record pages from this dataset on an ingestion portal show some records to have no thumbnails

Issues to explore:
* Are thumbnails generated by the CRF harvester? (Stored on S3)
* Are thumbnails, if generated, returned by the thumbnail API?
* Does this only affect records having no edm:object, vs records having an edm:isShownBy getting thumbnails

Outcomes:
* An explanation of the problem
* Recommendations as to how it can be addresed",3,,,2017-09-20T10:22:53.000Z,1,-45.0,true,11791963,"bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,d558KWlWir56pcacwqEsg8,b8Yzt4LNmr5ioUacwqjQXA",ck47vGwfer5j4iacwqjQXA,1,New,0,2017-09-20T10:22:53.000Z,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,bE4VAKECur4RFgacwqEsg8,"{""Theme""=>""""}",2,,,
